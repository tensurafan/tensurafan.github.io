I did say I’d give you the payment as agreed upon. Anyway, the consciousness of “that thing” has already been settled.

He then rings a bell and summons the secretary that seemed to have been waiting outside of the room.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_67"><span class="indent">“Did you summon me?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_68"><span class="indent">She looks elegant and dignified—a model secretary through and through.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_69"><span class="indent">Her beauty is decorated by pure, white skin which perfectly accentuates her braided blonde hair.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_70"><span class="indent">Her eyes are bright blue in color as if <span data-term="Shining" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with mysterious lazurite.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_71"><span class="indent">However, while the light in her eyes looks enthralling somehow, it does not seem to bear ill will.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_72"><span class="indent">“Huh? Eh, could you be…?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_73"><span class="indent">Laplace becomes suspicious of the woman’s appearance, yet in her eyes, Laplace finds a familiar presence. He then seems to recognize her true identity, and the realization quells his inner confusion. He bursts into laughter.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_74"><span class="indent">“Why are ya dressing like this? Has your highness undergone a sex change? I’d say it hardly suits you to dress like this. It’s completely different from what you used to look like.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_75"><span class="indent">“Shut up. It took me ten years to obtain a body that I can move around freely in. These types of inconveniences are more than tolerable.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_76"><span class="indent">The woman replies rudely, not willing to let Laplace berate her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_77"><span class="indent">Her model secretary like behavior disappears as she intimately pats Laplace on the shoulder and lets out ruffian laughter without a care. Then she sits down on a chair.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_78"><span class="indent">“So, you let me meet this guy means I can put down the act now, right?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_79"><span class="indent">“No, I hope you can still keep up the act at least on the outside. But since we’re all familiar with each other here, it would be unnecessary.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_80"><span class="indent">“Oh? I suppose I’ll just do as the boss says then. But for what reason exactly?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_81"><span class="indent">“About that, it’s because currently you are still too weak, Kazaream. You’ve yet to recover your full power, right? Until you’ve regained your full strength as the ‘Cursed Lord’, you should just sit back and observe Clayman.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_82"><span class="indent">Kazaream, the woman who looks like a secretary, sighed with discontent at his reply.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_83"><span class="indent">Kazaream.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_84"><span class="indent">That is the name of an ancient <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There once was a human named Leon who proclaimed himself a <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> near the border of Kazaream’s domain. Kazaream had then attempted to punish Leon for such bold declarations but was unsuccessful in the end.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_85"><span class="indent">And this former <span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kazaream is the being that both <span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman and Laplace wish to revive, and who also happens to be the president of the Moderate Jester Troupes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_86"><span class="indent">Yet nowadays, Kazaream is no longer in possession of such power and thus assumes the body of a fragile woman.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_87"><span class="indent">While near death, Kazaream was able to possess the flesh of this young man in a fateful encounter and thus cheated death. A few days earlier the former <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Astral Body was finally successfully transferred to the physical body of this homunculus.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_88"><span class="indent">Right now, his power is much weaker than it was during the days of his prime. As a result, Kazaream decided to recognize the young man as his master and to serve as his subordinate. This was the agreement between Kazaream and the young man, which is why he made no objections.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_89"><span class="indent">Having spent his time with the young man for ten years, Kazaream fully recognized him as his master.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_90"><span class="indent">“That’s right. My power has yet to fully recover. I was defeated by that <span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon so badly that I even lost my physical body. Sure my soul is able to settle in this homunculus, but this body is too fragile. If I am to fully release my magicules within it, it would completely destroy this body. That wouldn’t be a revival at all…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_91"><span class="indent">“Is that so, now I see. So even the president is calling you boss. In that case, I too shall accept you as my boss. You are no longer just another client. I guess there’s no reason to hide anything from you anymore.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_92"><span class="indent">“Seriously? You are one stubborn idiot. We’ve been collaborating for so long, and I even helped you revive your most precious president. Yet you still wouldn’t believe me till now…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_93"><span class="indent">“Hahaha, that’s a totally different matter. Speaking of which, the president taking on the appearance of a super model is absolutely hilarious!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_94"><span class="indent">“—Is that so? I don’t really care about my appearance.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_95"><span class="indent">“No no no, the contrast between how ya look and how ya talk is just too much; it’s absolutely hilarious.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_96"><span class="indent">“Whatev—No, I understand now. If I must keep up this act, I need to talk more like a woman.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_97"><span class="indent">“No no no, that isn’t the problem here, is it? Anyhow, it kinda suits ya better… But, how should I put this… WHAHAHAHA!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_98"><span class="indent">Laplace bursts into laughter, unable to continue.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_99"><span class="indent">“Oh now, please shut your trap. It’s not like I wanted to end up like this. This body is a <span data-term="Sorcerer’s Dynasty" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Sarion’s specially modified homunculus that boss has prepared just for me.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_100"><span class="indent">“Yeah. It’s quite expensive. If we didn’t prepare the container devoid of a soul, it may have contaminated the transferred soul, resulting in a failed transfer. Speaking of which, if Kazaream hadn’t escaped into my body, it might have already been mixed up with impurities and would have made it impossible to separate. In other words, I can’t really help with how it looks.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_101"><span class="indent">“I really appreciate that, Boss.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_102"><span class="indent">But there was no joy in the voice of this young man and Kazaream expresses gratitude towards him. Even so, he still seems rather irritated and was only able to bring his good mood back after Laplace joined in expressing thanks.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_103"><span class="indent">“I guess I’ll let it go this time. I get that you two must be experiencing a lot of feelings right now, reuniting after such a long time, but I want to talk business now. Let's hear the results of your investigations, Laplace.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_104"><span class="indent">With that, Kazaream loses his smile and turns towards Laplace. Laplace also nods back, changing his attitude, and starts talking in a more serious manner:</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_105"><span class="indent">“Since you kept your part of this bargain and granted my wish, I would like to show you my sincerity as well.

It becomes more difficult to control as the spell becomes more powerful. There are then more powerful spells such as Giant Magic Flame Barrier or Giant Magic Flame Storm that are very difficult to conjure. All in all, the difficulty of casting increases naturally with the power and scale of the spell.</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Sierra Note: Alright, so this is a bit complex, so I'll break it down for anyone who doesn't get it:" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_763"><span class="indent">So, let’s just analyze the name of spell casted by this Mister <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_764"><span class="indent">Special Greater Explosive Flame spell, to put it simply, is a synthesized magic spell.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_765"><span class="indent">It contains Fire spell that can burn and the Explosive spell that could blow away the target—By combining the two branches of spell, one can sublimate the two into a higher level of Explosive Flame Magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_766"><span class="indent">Speaking of that, it happens to be the type of magic wielded by Shizu-san.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_767"><span class="indent">The difference is that Shizu-san relied also on the power of Ifrit. It’s quite difficult to control a spirit if you aren’t a conjuring expert such as Shizu-san. But, as long as you establish a trusting relationship with the spirit, it will help out in times of need and hence help control the power.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_768"><span class="indent">So in contrast, when we talk about Special Greater Explosive Flame—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_769"><span class="indent">It is a very dangerous spell when one relies on himself to control the magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_770"><span class="indent">Even so, this type of magic is not limited by the magic system itself, so there is a lot of freedom in its usage.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_771"><span class="indent">The casting speed, accuracy, power, scale, area of effect, duration of effect; one can freely distribute the spell’s magnitude in all of these major elements. If he chooses to pursue purely power, it would be a piece of cake for him to cause havoc on the town.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_772"><span class="indent">But of course, this also increases the risks.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_773"><span class="indent">Conjuring spells require magicules, as well as sufficient concentration of mental abilities in order to gather the required amount. If the conjurer is incapable of doing that, the magic would not be cast. In addition, once the casting failed, the remained magicules could go out of control and turn the nearby area to a wasteland.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_774"><span class="indent">So it makes sense that why very few people actively practice such dangerous spells.

Teleportation magic can transport goods at relatively low cost. It can directly connect different dimensions to the coordinates of the teleportation location. This would induce a large amount of magicules to surround the area, unsuitable for transportation of organic matter. However, by using “Barrier” to protect their bodies, it will mitigate the effects during teleportation.

Alternatively, one can also cast the complete teleportation technique that invokes protection on the target&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2345"><span class="indent">That would mean as long as the target possess strength to withstand a large amount of magicule exposure, it can then pass through the special transportation dimension.
