<p class="no-indent" id="line_21">I, Shizue Izawa, am an otherworlder summoned into this world.</p>
<p id="line_22">The person who summoned me is one of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, the apex of this world, named Leon Cromwell. However, my being summoned is apparently not what he is seeking after. Even with the unimaginable power he has, it is very difficult to achieve what he is looking for. That is how harsh this world is. And I will come to be all too familiar with this fact.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_23">It’s early morning. My day started with harsh training. Just now, my sword got deflected and I was struck hard. As I fell to the ground, I was subjected to fierce scolding.</p>
<p id="line_24">“Mind your shield! Your sword should always be at the ready!”</p>
<p id="line_25">It was from the Black Knight Claude, famed as the strongest among the subordinates of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. He is my teacher.</p>
<p id="line_26">After <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon made me possess Ifrit, I came to be treated as a high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I became able to manipulate fire at will, and as a result, I began a life of disposing of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> forces that antagonize <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon seems not to be satisfied, as he has ordered his trusted confidant Claude-san to make me master martial arts. At first, I received guidance in a group, together with many people, adults and children alike. But before long, I was given special treatment and switched to one-on-one coaching.</p>
<p id="line_27">Training is hard. I am equipped with a wooden sword and shield that were made to weigh the same as the real ones. They were never adjusted to fit a child like me. They are so heavy that merely lifting them is arduous work. In addition, I am made to wear a padded undershirt containing sand, instead of armor, and when I fall down, getting back up is difficult enough. And even when I am struggling with that, my master, Claude-san, didn’t show a hint of compassion.</p>
<p id="line_28">“What are you doing? On your feet, now!”</p>
<p id="line_29">He scolded me again, this time with a kick. After sensing it, I avoided it feverishly. I thought I couldn’t move anymore, and yet my body reacted. This is all thanks to my ‘Unity’ with Ifrit. Before I knew it, I obtained power that made me a high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But even that power can’t beat Claude-san. After all, his status as the strongest subordinate of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is not just for show; he is not just some child who somehow became a high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> recently.</p>
<p id="line_30">“You’re slow,” he said, slamming his wooden sword against my shield. The shock sent a searing pain through my arm holding it. It hurt so bad, I think I might have broken a bone. Sadly, I came to learn to grasp the condition of my body from the intensity of the pain. In other words, I injured myself every single day, and that is not something to be praised for. At this rate, I’ll end up crippled from my training before I master martial arts.</p>
<p id="line_31">It isn’t like Claude-san cared about that, though.</p>
<p id="line_32">“Hold up your shield, or do you want your skull cracked open?”</p>
<p id="line_33">He scolded me heartlessly, while my eyes were watering from the pain. To be honest, I think Claude-san is an oni. I think he is being immature towards an eight-year old me. But, for Claude-san, he is still showing his utmost kindness in his own way, by making sure I don’t die.</p>
<p id="line_34">The cold healing medicine dripping down from my head is comforting.</p>
<p id="line_35"><em>Oh, I see.</em></p>
<p id="line_36">It looks like I was unable to avoid the blow to my head. I probably owe my life to the disaster hood I was wearing in place of a helmet.</p>
<p id="line_37">“A-are you okay?”</p>
<p id="line_38">I can hear Claude-san’s voice, in a panic somewhere. He was really strict during training, but that voice is very kind. Needless to say, even Claude-san would be punished if he were to kill an associate of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But that wasn’t the reason he was anxious; judging from the sound of his voice, I can feel that he’s genuinely concerned for me.</p>
<p id="line_39">That’s what gives me the strength to do my best.</p>
<p id="line_40">“I am fine.”</p>
<p id="line_41">“I-is that so? All right!”</p>
<p id="line_42">He breathed a sigh of relief. That soon faded away, and his usual stern gaze hit me.</p>
<p id="line_43">“That’s all the medicine for today. Don’t neglect your exercise so that you can react better tomorrow. Do longer training runs to build up the foundation of your physical strength!”</p>
<p id="line_44">“Yes, master.”</p>
<p id="line_45">Hearing my reply, Claude-san nodded with a “hmm.” That marked the end of today’s combat training. Then I started running as I was told, with the wooden sword and shield, while wearing the sand-padded undergarment. Normally, I wouldn’t be able to even take one step. But I can move now somehow. I unfortunately ended up being able to. I’m a little unhappy with the fact that it feels like I’ve stopped being a human, but it’s too late to regret that.</p>
<p id="line_46">After all, there was a new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attack something like once a week, and the role of Ifrit, who has assimilated with me, is to repel them all. I can’t make choices during battles, but I’m conscious, which makes me remember what I did. That’s why I fully understand I have to be strong. Age doesn’t matter in this world. If I want to survive, I have to figure out what I can do. On top of that, all I should do is to improve myself little by little. Knowing this, I kept running until noon, until I could hardly move.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_47">From noon till evening, I stand by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s side. He seldom talks to me now that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ attacks have gotten more frequent. He spends most of his day in his office. I’m not really sure myself, but apparently he has a lot of paperwork he has to deal with. When I heard that he works while I’m practicing, it gave me the impression that he’s a workaholic. I didn’t tell anyone, but I was surprised when I heard it because I thought that his job was to act all self-important and lord it over people.</p>
<p id="line_48">I stay in the throne room for about two hours during the day. Quite a few people come to see him every day. I don’t speak a word and just listen to the conversations. What I learned from them is that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is unexpectedly adored. About 90 percent of the visits were to report on how things were going and words of gratitude.</p>
<p id="line_49">This place is a hidden village in the Great Jura Forest, and even the castle was erected to be hidden behind the rocky mountains. Furthermore, it seems to have been magically concealed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s power, hiding it from public view. Despite that, it still gets attacked repeatedly, the reason being that this land was taken from another <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And no matter how much you try to conceal something, it’s moot when others already know where it is.</p>
<p id="line_50">Also the people who live in such a place are, to my surprise, like the slaves of the Eastern Empire and Western Countries. I heard that children of mixed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> blood are not strong enough to survive in an area inhabited by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and that they are subject to discrimination in human habitations. There is no place for them to live, and so some rather choose to be slaves. Others were forced to live for different reasons, including those who fell into slavery because they didn’t pay their taxes, those who were hunted down by bandits and sold off, and those who fled after being defeated in tribal wars. Some were even sold by their parents out of poverty. Now they all admire <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon.</p>
<p id="line_51">As for my case, I know the miseries of war. I realized that my mother was going through a lot of hardship because food rations were tight. Still, that was better than what the people I saw here have experienced. So I can understand their reverence for the person who has saved them.</p>
<p id="line_52">But that makes me more puzzled. Why is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon helping people in secret?</p>
<p id="line_53">“Hm, pitiful people. All it takes is a little mercy to fill their hearts with loyalty to me.”</p>
<p id="line_54">Perhaps <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon noticed my gaze as he said those words with a sneer. That’s the attitude I expected from a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I was almost fooled. As I thought, he’s a bad guy. I didn’t say it out loud, but I vowed to myself that I would never be deceived about that again.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_55">One day, through a casual conversation with Claude-san during my training, I asked where the people who gathered had gone.</p>
<p id="line_56">“His Majesty Leon has sent all the people that gathered to work to his country, which is a safe place for them to live. However, only those who are deemed worthy to be his own people after their aptitude is judged here will be sent there.”</p>
<p id="line_57">Apparently, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon rules a vast territory apart from this land. Claude-san said that the purpose of this place was to select suitable people to live there.</p>
<p id="line_58">“But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attack here every day, and bad <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s have their eyes on Leon-sama. If his country is safe, isn’t it better for Leon-sama to move there?”</p>
<p id="line_59">Ignoring something complicated such as selecting people, I thought it would be better for a king to be in a safe place. My job is to guard <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. It would be easier to protect him if he stayed in a safe place, meaning my job would be way easier…</p>
<p id="line_60">“Hahaha, you’re pretty smart, Shizu. But he can’t do that. Drawing the enemy’s attention is a core reason for remaining here.”</p>
<p id="line_61">“Enemy? Are we trying to stand out, while also staying hidden?”</p>
<p id="line_62">What does that mean? We are supposed to be living here in secret, so how does that make sense when our purpose is to attract attention?</p>
<p id="line_63">“Hm, there are several reasons, but the problem is that the kingdom is under construction. It will be an impregnable city once the construction is complete, but as of now, it’s still dangerous. By keeping the enemy’s eyes on us <em>here</em>, we can keep the work <em>there</em> uninterrupted. Then again, the future site borders on the territory of another wickedly dangerous guy. Fortunately, there haven’t been any hostilities; we’re just keeping an eye out for now. Whom we should be more cautious about is a man named Clayman, who is actively hostile towards us.”</p>
<p id="line_64">Clayman is also a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I was surprised when I learned that there is more than one <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and to hear that we have our eyes on such a terrifying person frightens me.</p>
<p id="line_65">“Can I defeat him?”</p>
<p id="line_66">“That’s got to be impossible. Not yet. Ifrit is a powerful spirit, and now that you became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you’ll become even stronger. But still, you can’t win against a disaster-class.”</p>
<p id="line_67">“That’s…”</p>
<p id="line_68">“That’s why, Shizu. Be stronger. Train harder to protect His Majesty Leon. Be stronger until no one can defeat you!” Claude-san encouraged me, and I agreed with a “yeah!”</p>
<p id="line_69">I don’t quite get the logic about becoming stronger to protect <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, who is much stronger than me, but I don’t need any reason to become strong. This is not the world where I was scared of air-raids and lost my mother. You can become stronger the harder you try in this world, and in order for me to live through I will become strong. Now, I’m still just completely relying on Ifrit’s power, but still, I will be able to master its power someday and protect the people within my reach.</p>
<p id="line_70">“By that time, I will also protect Master Claude!”</p>
<p id="line_71">“Hahaha, you cheeky child. If that’s the case, I shall not hold back with your training!”</p>
<p id="line_72">With that, I had to spend more intense days of training.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_73">The contents of my training were not only related to martial arts, but also a wide range of other things.</p>
<p id="line_74">“Shall we learn about manners today?”</p>
<p id="line_75">The one who said that was the one standing at my back and is one of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s confidants, Silver Knight Alrose-sama. He usually supervises the construction of the country on behalf of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. He’s a very busy individual, but he still manages to regularly come to the base in the Great Jura Forest to report. It appears that he was appointed to teach me table manners tonight.</p>
<p id="line_76">“Um, meals are usually Master Claude’s…”</p>
<p id="line_77">“He’s no good. Sure, that man is skillful, but he’s unrefined. I’ve been told he has almost killed you countless times.”</p>
<p id="line_78">“T-that, that’s because of my carelessness—”</p>
<p id="line_79">“You fool. It’s ridiculous to be serious about killing a child who is not even ten years old,” Alrose-sama said bitterly, criticizing Claude-san. I don’t agree with what he said, but the food was brought to the table faster than I could make a retort.</p>
<p id="line_80">“First is the hors d’oeuvre. Eat it using the outermost fork and knife,” he said, as the woman who was sitting in front of me demonstrated it.</p>
<p id="line_81">Use your knife to pull the salad into your fork then to your mouth in a graceful manner. Make sure to carefully adjust the size with the knife to make the salad bite-sized. That’s what he explained to me, but I had no time to follow all that.</p>
<p id="line_82">Alrose-sama patiently supervised my movements. That’s why I tried looking at the woman’s demonstration and desperately imitated her.</p>
<p id="line_83">“Hm. You used to use a utensil called chopsticks in your hometown. I looked it up, and apparently there are some parts in this world that also use such a utensil. There was no custom of using forks and knives in those areas, so I thought it would be difficult for you to use them, but…you’re surprisingly skillful at this.”</p>
<p id="line_84">Did he praise me? If so, that makes me glad. When I came to this world, there was one thing that made me happy. It was that meals were served to me every day. If you train hard, you get hungry. I was worried about what to do if I didn’t have enough food, but that turned out to be a non-issue. I was told that it was a crude menu, but compared to the ration yam I received in my previous world, it was nothing short of a feast. They gave me vegetable soup and bread, hearty stew, and sometimes meat.</p>
<p id="line_85">At first, I was perplexed by these unfamiliar dishes, but once I tried them, they were so delicious that I quickly adapted to the food here. I learned how to eat their food through observation and imitation. Because it would be a waste if I spilled or left too much food. That’s why I learned proper eating manners, or so I thought…</p>
<p id="line_86">“However, it’s still far from elegant. Good thing I’m doing something about it early. At this rate, you might grow a bad habit.”</p>
<p id="line_87">To Alrose-sama, my gestures were totally no good. Then, he reprimanded me at the next soup.</p>
<p id="line_88">“Don’t slurp it. And most especially, don’t make a noise!” he scolded me with a slap on my shoulder.</p>
<p id="line_89">I noticed he was carrying a short stick, but I didn’t expect it was for this use. It was not unbearable, but I cried a little from the shock of being hit, not like Alrose-sama cared though.</p>
<p id="line_90">“Again.”</p>
<p id="line_91">Then I did it again about five times, and finally passed. Though, just barely.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_92">Then the next harsh lesson started. Delicious dishes that I had never seen appeared one after another. In spite of that, I was so desperate to learn manners that I had no time to taste the food. When it was over, I got exhausted, and Alrose-sama didn’t waste a second to reprimand me.</p>
<p id="line_93">“Straighten up! Don’t forget that the most important thing while eating is your posture.”</p>
<p id="line_94">That’s why they even prepared a special chair for me. Alrose-sama is right, after all.</p>
<p id="line_95">“Anyway, I didn’t expect you to remember everything today. I’ll give you this opportunity once a week, so you will study with her from now on. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask her.”</p>
<p id="line_96">Alrose-sama introduced the woman who demonstrated for him. I wasn’t able to ask for her name during the lecture, but to my surprise, she was a colleague of both Alrose-sama and Claude-san. Her name was Maetel, the White Knight, one of the confidants of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. I heard she specializes in recovery magic.</p>
<p id="line_97">“There must be some things you can’t discuss with men, right? Don’t hesitate to ask me anything,” Maetel-san said with a smile. She seems very nice. She reminds me of my mother a little. Not wanting to get sentimental, I smiled back at Maetel-san.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_98">Maetel-san said that manners don’t have to be so formal. Since I’m a bodyguard of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, I might need to join banquets. She said that’s the reason why Alrose-sama is trying to make me able to handle such a situation.</p>
<p id="line_99">“Even if there were, they would only be with merchants, so I don’t think you have to use such formal manners as dealing with aristocrats. Well, you lose nothing by learning them, so good luck.”</p>
<p id="line_100">I was relieved to hear that. And one more thing.</p>
<p id="line_101">“You can eat delicious food, no? It’s Shizu-chan’s reward for doing her best.”</p>
<p id="line_102">But it would be better if she’d let me eat them more freely.</p>
<p id="line_103">“Tee-hee, of course, I can’t do that. I can’t just show partiality to you for no reason. So, if you want to taste delicious food, learn the etiquette and become a lady soon.”</p>
<p id="line_104">I’m quite disappointed to hear that, but at the same time, I also want to become a wonderful woman like Maetel-san. I shall do my best and be approved soon.</p>
<p id="line_105">I made up my mind and secretly kindled the flame of my motivation.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_106">The combat training is still handled by Master Claude. And Maetel-san taught me various other affairs. She told me that there are nine other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s in this world aside from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. And there are also four beings more dangerous than them—the True Dragons. Rather than teaching me general knowledge, she proceeded with educating me about such dangerous beings.</p>
<p id="line_107">“There wouldn’t be a problem if you embarrassed yourself in the town or castle, as you could just reflect and learn from it. But if you failed in dealing with an entity of disaster like a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would be over at that point. There would be no next time, so you wouldn’t be able to reflect on it. That’s why, it might be too early for you, but I want you to learn these important matters,” Maetel-san said.</p>
<p id="line_108">As a bodyguard to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, I might meet such individuals. So she helped me to be more cautious so as to not cause trouble when that happened.</p>
<p id="line_109">True Dragons are immortal creatures. Currently, there are only three confirmed to be active, as the other one is still awaiting its resurrection. And one of those three is sealed somewhere here in the Great Jura Forest. Some entity called a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was responsible for that.

At present, there are only four alive.</p>
<p id="line_110">The Golden-Haired <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the Masked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the Western Guardian, and the Imperial emperor. The latter is supposedly a descendant of a hero, but whether he is a hero himself or not is unclear. There’s also a famous elven hero who fought against an evil dragon, but it’s unknown whether she’s alive.</p>
<p id="line_111">“They say the one who sealed the True Dragon—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Storm Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Veldora—was the masked hero.

<p id="line_112">“…Huh?” I sputtered, bewildered</p>
<p id="line_113">Maetel-san just chuckled. Her attitude tells me that she has no intention of letting me in on everything that easily. Convinced of this, I vowed to myself to put in more effort.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_114">Incidentally, though very unexpected, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon also cautioned me. The progress of my education was put to test in his spare time during an audience with him. During that, he told me that there are also very troublesome beings. It was not I who answered the question, but my instructor, Claude-san. That said, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon was not convinced.</p>
<p id="line_115">“Her odds? Claude, you would’ve been right had you been training your average warrior. But Shizu is different. If you leave everything to Ifrit, your strength will immediately reach its peak. As proof, you did nothing at all in the battles against the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, Shizu.”</p>
<p id="line_116">“But Shizu is still a child. It’s only natural she couldn’t do anything.”</p>
<p id="line_117"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon snorted and ignored Claude-san. He then turned and glared at me with piercing eyes.</p>
<p id="line_118">“Shizu, are you fine with completely relying on Ifrit?”</p>
<p id="line_119">There’s no way I am. The reason I’m training hard is to reduce the number of unhappy people. In order for me to survive and to protect those I can protect with these hands, I need to be strong. In order to do this, I should not let Ifrit alone do all the fighting.</p>
<p id="line_120">“No.”</p>
<p id="line_121">That’s why I answered honestly.</p>
<p id="line_122">“That’s good to hear. Don’t be a burden; be a useful tool. In order to do so, you must be able to make the most of the ‘unity’ with Ifrit and master using its power. If you semi-materialize your body, physical attacks won’t work, even without a shield. And that sword—”</p>
<p id="line_123">With a glance at the heavily modified wooden sword, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon knitted his brows.</p>
<p id="line_124">“…It’s pointless. Shizu would be better off lashing her enemies with speed, rather than relying on brute strength. Speed is the most important factor in battle. If you don’t train for it, instead becoming a turtle; only death will await you should your shell ever crack.”</p>
<p id="line_125">These are harsh words, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is right. However, Claude-san didn’t seem convinced.</p>
<p id="line_126">“With all due respect, Leon-sama, are you intending to change Shizu’s weapon into a rapier? After all, if you do such a thing, Shizu’s means of defense will decrease. It is next to impossible to block the enemy’s sword with a rapier.”</p>
<p id="line_127">“I can,” he stated.</p>
<p id="line_128">“Shizu is not like you, Leon-sama,” Clause insisted. “First of all—”</p>
<p id="line_129">“She can.”</p>
<p id="line_130">That declaration was equivalent to an order.</p>
<p id="line_131">“Understood. In that case, I shall reconsider Shizu-san’s training,” Claude-san conceded.</p>
<p id="line_132">“All right.”</p>
<p id="line_133">Probably feeling satisfied, he was about to leave, but then stopped halfway and looked back at me.</p>
<p id="line_134">“Shizu, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Talk more with Ifrit. Reach a mutual understanding with it and take its power for yourself. If you don’t, you’ll be consumed by it.”</p>
<p id="line_135">That made me wonder. Because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon wanted Ifrit to possess a new body… By new body, he means me…</p>
<p id="line_136">“Leon-sama, didn’t you want me to be a body for Ifrit?” I asked him without thinking, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon clicked his tongue. He looked pretty upset, but he was still willing to answer.</p>
<p id="line_137">“Spirits are lifeforms of no free will. As they approach becoming a greater spirit, they develop a sense of self. But they have no emotions. They cannot distinguish right from wrong, and will only do what their master ordered them to do, just like a machine. That’s why, I want you to guide it to new heights by having it learn from your conversations.”</p>
<p id="line_138">I asked him the question while thinking he might get mad at me, but surprisingly, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon gave a serious explanation. I’ve never had such a long conversation with him. And his explanation was very convincing because it was about Ifrit’s development. Evidently, Ifrit does not know swordsmanship. It makes sense that I can be stronger by supplementing that part.</p>
<p id="line_139">“I suppose you will never meet <em>her</em>, but she is there in <em>that</em> land—one of the rulers of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> named Jaune, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yellow Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

He’s a real piece of work and—”</p>
<p id="line_140"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s explanation was short, but the gist of it was clear. In short, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s are very dangerous. I don’t think I’ll ever meet them, but I kept in mind to be careful.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_141">I learned quite a bit through this. Unfortunately, there was nothing that I would have learnt from school ever thought to me. After all, they told me I wouldn’t be needing to write anything and so I didn’t have to study it.</p>
<p id="line_142">“Aren’t you going to teach me to learn the language, math, or history?”</p>
<p id="line_143">I thought those things are essential things to learn at school, so I tried to ask the question. Maetel-san was perplexed, but answered smiling: “Our country is new. So, there’s not enough history to teach. Besides, most of our people are illiterate, so the establishment of educational institutions is a future task. That’s why it would be inefficient to teach only you.”</p>
<p id="line_144">Luckily, a common language is used in the Sorcerer’s Dynasty, which is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s main business partner, and the human lands, such as the Western Nations and the Eastern Empire. There are many different countries, yet there’s only one language. I was surprised to hear that, but she followed up with something even more surprising.</p>
<p id="line_145">“First of all, Shizu-chan, you and I are speaking different languages. Haven’t you noticed?”</p>
<p id="line_146">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_147">“Hee-hee. As expected, you haven’t. Speech conveying a person’s will can be analyzed with magic. That’s the reason why you can’t talk to other adults.”</p>
<p id="line_148">Now that she mentioned it, maybe that’s indeed the case. I thought I was certainly being hated because I was an outsider, but I guess I was mistaken.</p>
<p id="line_149">“Good grief, shame to Claude-dono. He did not teach you the most important thing. Even if it’s too early for you to learn magic, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ is a foundation of battle.”</p>
<p id="line_150">After that conversation, Claude-san and Maetel-san had an argument, and in the end, it was decided that Claude-san would teach me ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’</p>
<p id="line_151">“Yeah, sorry about that,” Claude-san apologized. “If you learned this first, you’d lose the ability to sense killing intents and presence, so I thought I should put off teaching you ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ I totally forgot that you couldn’t talk to anyone but us.”</p>
<p id="line_152">At the sight of me gravely shaking my head, he laughed. Then he gently stroked my head.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_153">The next day, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was added to my class, and it took me about 2 weeks to get it. Then, indeed, I was able to communicate with people I had not been able to communicate with before. I even made friends. This is how I got used to life in this world.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>

Fighting is scary, but everything will soon be over if I just leave it to Ifrit. Training is harder for me. The days of being badly beaten by Claude-san continue.</p>
<p id="line_155">One day, something unusual happened. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon appeared during my training.</p>
<p id="line_156">“Claude, this fighting style…doesn’t fit Shizu.”</p>
<p id="line_157">That’s the first thing he said. He glared at me with a sullen expression on his face. I hid behind Claude-san in fear, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon had no time for my antics.</p>
<p id="line_158">“Shizu, show yourself.”</p>
<p id="line_159">I cannot disobey his order. Having no choice, I stepped forward and stood facing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon.</p>
<p id="line_160">“This get-up is also a problem. Why are you carrying a shield?”</p>
<p id="line_161">“Leon-sama, if we let Shizu get used to a heavy shield, her defense will become as hard as an iron wall. With Ifrit, she can increase her odds in battle.”</p>
<p id="line_162">“I understand. I will strive to get closer to Ifrit-san,” I added.</p>
<p id="line_163">But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon still had a troubled look on his face. The wrinkle between his eyebrows seems to be getting deeper… I want to think I’m only imagining it.</p>
<p id="line_164">“Strive.”</p>
<p id="line_165">In the end, Demo Lord Leon left without saying anything more.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_166">Several years came and went. Maybe because I was recognized as an executive, I was allowed to move about freely, to some extent. My symbiotic relationship with Ifrit is going well, and my free time has increased. Perhaps it was this sense of relief that caught me off guard and led to the tragedy.</p>
<p id="line_167">I have killed Pirino, my friend, with my own hands. The reason was that Ifrit went out of control, but that was because I failed to control it. That day I lost something important to me as a human.</p>
<p id="line_168">‘As I thought, it was too early to allow her to go free.’</p>
<p id="line_169">‘I’m sorry. I got careless because Shizu was excellent.’</p>
<p id="line_170">‘But now that it has come to this—it’s impossible for her to live with us…’</p>
<p id="line_171">‘Hm, I have no need for unusable tools. It won’t be long before we leave this base. Let’s leave Shizu behind then.’</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_172">It feels like the conversation took place in a misty distant place. It seems to have been a long discussion, but the last words strangely remained in my mind. It was the words <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon seems to have uttered—<em>I have no need for unusable tools.</em> Only those words echoed repeatedly in my mind until I lost consciousness.</p>
<p id="line_173">And then, it was when I was left alone in the abandoned castle, waiting for an enemy that may come, that I regained consciousness. I don’t know what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon really intended when he told me to stay. There is no point in my staying here because they fled without fighting the enemy. But the fact that I was left behind here means that they’ve abandoned me.</p>
<p id="line_174">It seems that’s the case, but I don’t want to believe it. Master Claude, Maetel-san, and even Alrose-sama were all kind to me. I also made some friends…those that worked in the castle—but Pirino is already gone. Right. She was killed by Ifrit—my own hands. That’s why there’s no way we can reach a mutual understanding anymore. If the spirit can learn and grow through its mutual influence with the host, then my relationship with Ifrit is the worst. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon abandoned me. Broken tools are of no value to him… That’s the only reason I could think of as to why he abandoned me. For some reason, I remembered the eyes of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. Those cold, unfeeling eyes. That person, who hates useless things… Did he really abandon me for that reason? What if he had something else in mind?</p>
<p id="line_175">Maybe I’m just trying to find excuses because I can’t move on. My desire to have that warmth again does not allow me to accept reality. And now it’s gone and never to be obtained again. Still, I keep my unfulfilled wish in my heart.</p>

<h1 class="ch-name">Shizue Izawa’s Adventuring Life Part 1</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_186">Several years had passed since the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” took me under her wing. Before I realized it, I had made a name for myself within the Adventurers’ Guild. With the “Anti-Magic Mask” inherited from the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” some began to see me as her successor. It was around this time that I earned the title “Conqueror of Flames.” I believed all of this was thanks to the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” but she disliked it whenever I expressed my gratitude. She also insisted that I never speak to her formally.</p>
<p id="line_187">‹Just call me <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, without any honorifics. But please, try not to use that name in front of others›, she said, urging me to address her casually. When I asked why, she would deflect the question with nonsensical remarks like, ‹If anything, I’d rather call you ‘Shizu-san.’ So, please bear with it.› This became an unspoken agreement between us—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” and I would not delve into this matter further.</p>
<p id="line_188">We built a strong bond, and I was at the pinnacle of my happiness. Then, one day, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> left on a journey. ‹I’m sure we’ll meet again›, she said, leaving only those words behind. Though I was saddened, I knew I couldn’t remain in sorrow forever. Determined to grow stronger, I began expanding my activities beyond national borders.</p>
<p id="line_189">And so, time went on…</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_190">Due to an urgent situation, I was summoned to the Adventurers’ Guild in the Kingdom of Blumund. As soon as I entered the guild building, I was escorted directly to the reception room, where I found the person I expected—Heinz-san, one of the directors of the Adventurers’ Guild.</p>
<p id="line_191">“Hey there, Shizu-san. Thanks for coming.”</p>
<p id="line_192">“You know I’d rush over from anywhere if you called, Heinz-san. So, what’s going on?”</p>
<p id="line_193">Heinz-san had known me since I was young and had taken care of me quite a bit. It was only natural that I would heed his requests.</p>
<p id="line_194">He chuckled warmly, just as he had in the old days. “Hahaha, even though you’re now a renowned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you haven’t changed a bit, Shizu-san. But I’m glad. This situation is a bit tricky, and I think it might be too much for you to handle alone. So I’ve also called my son for help. That idiot hasn’t arrived yet, so let me explain the details to you first.”</p>
<p id="line_195">He laughed heartily, but the years had caught up with him—his hair now streaked with white. Seeing this, I couldn’t help but feel a bit sentimental, realizing how much time had passed. My own growth and aging had stopped, leaving me looking about sixteen, unchanged. I had grown somewhat indifferent to this, but even Heinz-san wasn’t immune to the passage of time. I owed him so much, more than I could ever repay.</p>
<p id="line_196"><em>Perhaps I should visit this country more often from now on,</em> I thought as I listened to Heinz-san’s explanation.</p>
<p id="line_197">The emergency was indeed serious, but it wasn’t about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attacking. Instead, it concerned a suspicious organization operating in the Kingdom of Grada, the neighboring country to Blumund.</p>
<p id="line_198">“Could it be devilkin?”</p>
<p id="line_199">The Kingdom of Grada was smaller than the Kingdom of Blumund, with a population of just under 300,000 and limited territory. Its military strength was weak, and if Calamity-class <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> targeted them, they wouldn’t stand a chance.</p>
<p id="line_200"><em>Although, naturally, the capital is protected by a Barrier, making it difficult for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to infiltrate…</em></p>
<p id="line_201">“Well, that’s that. Investigating it is part of the job this time. In other words, we’re completely in the dark. Normally, I would have refused such a dangerous request…”</p>
<p id="line_202">Heinz-san’s concern was understandable. While adventurers were often seen as expendable, that didn’t mean their lives should be wasted unnecessarily. No one wanted a pointless death. Ideally, thorough investigations would be conducted beforehand, but in this case, there was no time for that. Moreover, it seemed to involve trouble in a neighboring country.</p>
<p id="line_203">Adventurers didn’t belong to any specific country, so borders didn’t matter to them. However, sending a large number of adventurers intervening could be problematic. Whether that country would accept them was another matter altogether. In this case, it all depended on how the Kingdom of Grada would respond. The decision to allow adventurers in for an investigation would rest with the higher authorities in Grada.</p>
<p id="line_204">“As you know, the Kingdom of Grada does not border the Great Forest of Jura. It lies between our country and the great nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That’s why they have relatively few adventurers, and we received the request for assistance here.”</p>
<p id="line_205">“Maybe the Kingdom of Grada has nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p id="line_206">If Grada was involved, it would make things easier. If they requested assistance, we could cooperate with confidence, knowing the rewards would be assured. However, if there was no official involvement, we might not receive any support at all. In the worst case, they could even deny us entry. The cooperative relationship between the state and the Adventurers’ Guild varied from country to country. I always thought this needed improvement, but the reality was that things often didn’t go smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_207">“It’s probably close to the worst-case scenario you’re thinking of, Shizu-san.”</p>
<p id="line_208">“Does that mean…?”</p>
<p id="line_209">“Yeah. The Kingdom of Grada seems to dislike outside intervention, so they probably won’t tolerate adventurers acting freely within their borders,” Heinz-san said, sighing heavily. Instead of receiving national support, we were facing the possibility of outright obstruction. It was clear that even the guild was at a loss in this situation. The fact that Heinz-san called me despite such difficulties suggested there must be a very compelling reason behind it.</p>
<p id="line_210">“The client is from the guild in the Kingdom of Grada, aren’t they? So how did their request reach here?”</p>
<p id="line_211">It must have been through transmission magic or a messenger. In this world, there were no convenient devices like telephones, so magical communication was often used for emergencies. However, relying on that alone could make it difficult to convey the severity and specifics of a situation. For this reason, in urgent cases, messengers known as “foot couriers” were often employed to deliver messages swiftly.</p>
<p id="line_212">Foot couriers were individuals who could use magic to reduce fatigue and enhance their leg strength. While they might not be particularly strong in combat, they could run faster than most <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If the message came from a neighboring country, they should have arrived in less than two days. And I received the message exactly two days ago.</p>
<p id="line_213">“Sharp as ever, Shizu-san. Being trained by a hero certainly paid off!”</p>
<p id="line_214">“Don’t tease me.”</p>
<p id="line_215">“Sorry, sorry. The magical transmission came two days ago. If that had been all, I was planning to reject the request, but they also mentioned sending a foot courier at the same time. That gave me a bad feeling, so I hurriedly contacted you. It seemed urgent, like something we needed to be ready for.”</p>
<p id="line_216">If calling me had turned out to be unnecessary, it would have affected the guild’s credibility. Even if I didn’t mind, Heinz-san would, being the serious person he was. And his hunch was right—when the messenger finally arrived, it became clear that this request couldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p id="line_217">“So, I guess it’s good that my visit wasn’t wasted? We can’t refuse the request now, right?”</p>
<p id="line_218">“Yeah. The messenger who arrived was Alfred Grada, the third prince of the Kingdom of Grada.”</p>
<p id="line_219">I was momentarily speechless. A prince acting as a messenger? I had never heard of anything so outlandish. It wasn’t impossible, but in that case, there should have been a large entourage, including bodyguards.</p>
<p id="line_220"><em>I don’t think it’s possible for him to cover this distance in two days, but he actually has arrived?</em></p>
<p id="line_221">“Is he really the prince?”</p>
<p id="line_222">“No doubt about it. He had a royal-issued ID, using the magical medium also employed for contracts. So, he was definitely the real deal. And it turns out, Prince Alfred himself is the client for this request.”</p>
<p id="line_223">No wonder we couldn’t refuse. But this sounded like a rather troublesome situation, especially since the client was a prince, yet cooperation from the Kingdom of Grada wasn’t forthcoming.</p>
<p id="line_224">“Understood. Well then, tell me the details,” I prompted Heinz-san to continue, but before he could, a fierce presence approached outside the reception room, and the door suddenly swung open.</p>
<p id="line_225">“Wait a minute, old man! This is an internal issue of the Kingdom of Grada. Just because the client is a prince doesn’t mean we should get involved!” A young man who closely resembled Heinz-san burst into the room. It had to be Heinz-san’s son, Fuze-kun.</p>
<p id="line_226">When Fuze-kun was a little kid, I used to carry him around, though he didn’t seem to remember. I had heard he had been on a warrior’s journey recently, traveling through the western countries to train. It was good to see he was doing well. He was slightly shorter than me, but his strong presence was undeniable. It seemed like he had grown quite skilled, which made me happy for him.</p>
<p id="line_227">As I was reflecting on this, a parent-child quarrel erupted right before my eyes.</p>
<p id="line_228">“Shut up, Fuze! Sure, it’s an issue of the Kingdom of Grada, but that doesn’t mean it has nothing to do with us! Also, even with soundproofing magic, we shouldn’t be discussing such matters so loudly. Sit down. Or are you scared? If you are, then I won’t rely on you. Just leave now!”</p>
<p id="line_229">“What did you say? That I’m scared? Hah, you think that woman over there is more reliable than me? She was celebrated as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> over twenty years ago. Her glory days are long gone, and now she’s just coasting on her reputation. To rely on someone like that—”</p>
<p id="line_230">“I told you to shut up!”</p>
<p id="line_231">Heinz-san, who had risen from his chair, swiftly moved and punched Fuze-kun. His actions revealed his experience as a seasoned adventurer. Even after stepping back from the front lines, his move was truly impressive.</p>
<p id="line_232">“Pweh, that hurt, you know! I thought an old man like you wouldn’t pack a punch, but that actually stung. But you know what, I’ve been through my fair share of battles too. I’m tired of being seen as less capable than my old man forever.”</p>
<p id="line_233">“Tch, you’re getting cheeky. Well, whatever. If you’re going to talk big like that, I’ll involve you in this case. Come in and sit down.”</p>
<p id="line_234">“I’ll allow that, but what about her?”</p>
<p id="line_235">“This case could be managed without you, but Shizu-san is absolutely necessary. From what I know, she’s the strongest person after the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”’</p>
<p id="line_236">“Damn it, you’re saying she’s better than me? Whatever. I’ll prove my strength surpasses yours in this matter,” Fuze-kun glared at me and plopped down heavily onto the sofa—for some reason, right next to me. So, I didn’t think he actually disliked me…</p>
<p id="line_237"><em>Maybe it’s just a rebellious phase? Perhaps boys his age should be lively like this.</em></p>
<p id="line_238">To me, who didn’t have children, Fuze-kun seemed quite adorable.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_239">Heinz-san also took a seat, and the discussion resumed. The option to refuse this request had vanished now. I hadn’t intended to refuse, but if I did, I worried Fuze-kun might do something reckless. If it came to that, I felt it would be more reassuring to keep a close watch myself.</p>
<p id="line_240">“—Well, let me fill you in on the specifics.”</p>
<p id="line_241">Although it seemed Fuze-kun had eavesdropped on us using a skill, we started over from the beginning. Information gathering was important, but even more crucial was information sharing. Adventurers knew that assumptions were the most dangerous thing to carry.</p>
<p id="line_242">Just as Heinz-san was about to begin explaining, the door swung open once again. The faint presence suggested whoever it was, they were quite skilled.</p>
<p id="line_243">“I’ll handle that explanation.”</p>
<p id="line_244">“Prince Alfred—?!”</p>
<p id="line_245">“Quiet. Here, I’d prefer you to call me Al,” Prince Alfred—who entered—said and smiled gently, keeping Heinz-san in check.</p>
<p id="line_246">As he said, I would call him Al, “As you said, Al-san, please explain.”</p>
<p id="line_247">“Hey, hey, who would actually call him that?”</p>
<p id="line_248">“Hahaha, as expected of the famous ‘Conqueror of Flames.’ I appreciate that you get straight to the point.”</p>
<p id="line_249">“…That’s right. Either way, it’s not good to use real names here. My prince—no, I shall call you Al. Fuze, you should read the room too.”</p>
<p id="line_250">“Tch, I get it.”</p>
<p id="line_251">Surprisingly, Fuze-kun agreed. He seemed to have a good sense of judgment, and with more experience, he was likely to grow into a great adventurer.</p>
<p id="line_252">“So, Al, are you sure you don’t need to rest?”</p>
<p id="line_253">“No problem. I got a good two hours of sleep, after all.”</p>
<p id="line_254">“Then let me introduce these people first. You might already know them, but just to be thorough.” With that, Heinz-san introduced me and Fuze-kun to Al-san.</p>
<p id="line_255">“This is the maximum force we can mobilize. If we move with a large group, the enemy will likely catch on, so a small, elite team would be best, right?”</p>
<p id="line_256">“I appreciate it. Relying on you, Heinz-dono, was the right decision.”</p>
<p id="line_257">“Hmph! The moment you came here alone, I could pretty much figure out the situation. So, what’s the current status?”</p>
<p id="line_258">“Yes, let me explain from the beginning. You probably have many questions, but please listen to what I have to say first.”</p>
<p id="line_259">It seemed we were finally about to get a detailed explanation. We had received a rough overview earlier, but now that Al-san was here in person, we would likely get a more thorough account of the situation. We needed to form a plan based on this information, and it was crucial that the plan’s success rate was as high as possible. Refusing wasn’t an option, so it was my job to maximize our chances of success.</p>
<p id="line_260">With that in mind, I listened carefully to Al-san’s story. While the situation wasn’t the absolute worst, it was far from optimistic. Here’s what became clear:</p>
<p id="line_261">There was a suspicious organization operating in the Kingdom of Grada, apparently based in a church. This organization, for some reason, possessed vast amounts of wealth, which they used to bribe nobles within the kingdom. As a result, instead of the expected first prince, the much-maligned second prince had come closer to the position of crown prince. Up to this point, it might seem like a domestic issue, and from the perspective of other nations, it was just an internal squabble. Sure, succession disputes in royal families were problematic, but given the Kingdom of Grada’s small size, it was expected that it wouldn’t attract much attention from other countries. However, the real issue was not the family disputes but the behind-the-scenes manipulation. The devilkin I was initially worried about were not involved. While that was a relief, the current adversary was potentially even more malicious.</p>
<p id="line_262">“Does the name Echidna ring a bell?”</p>
<p id="line_263">We fell silent at Al-san’s words. The organization—Echidna—was notorious as an underworld force from the Eastern Empire. They were said to have anywhere from tens of thousands to even millions of members, making them a threat that small countries couldn’t handle. Not only in the Kingdom of Grada but also in the Kingdom of Blumund, safety was not guaranteed if targeted by Echidna. Fortunately, Blumund was a member of the Council of West. In an emergency, it would be possible to appeal to the Council for support against Echidna. But…</p>
<p id="line_264">“You serious? The Kingdom of Grada isn’t a member of the Council, right?”</p>
<p id="line_265">“I see. So the Empire plans to use the Kingdom of Grada as a foothold to begin conquering the western countries.”</p>
<p id="line_266">“That’s right. My elder brother, Reinhardt, was investigating the financial sources of my second older brother Edward’s faction. He suspected Echidna’s involvement. The church they are based in was in opposition to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They constantly insulted each other’s gods and were always at odds. Echidna cleverly exploited this rivalry and absorbed the church. In the Kingdom of Grada, the state religion has been worshiping Jilzaridhara for generations. By controlling that church, it became easier for them to connect with the nobility. By the time we realized it, it was already too late.”</p>
<p id="line_267">The state religion of the Kingdom of Grada was a native belief in a deity called Jilzaridhara. While some followed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the majority adhered to Jilzaridharism, with a ratio of about three to seven. This was one reason why the nation’s membership in the Council had been delayed. From Echidna’s perspective, Grada must have seemed like very convenient prey.</p>
<p id="line_268">“But who would’ve thought they’d bare their fangs at the nation itself…”</p>
<p id="line_269">“The problem ain’t that. Assuming that story is true. Echidna is backing that fella Edward to take over the Kingdom of Grada, right? This might already be beyond our control, ain’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_270">It might sound rude to say this, but Fuze-kun seemed quicker on the uptake than I’d initially given him credit for. If he was going to back out here, I was going to say no, too. This was no longer a problem for adventurers to handle. While devilkin were enemies of humanity, Echidna was part of humanity itself—albeit a shady part.</p>
<p id="line_271">“Indeed, it’s hard to argue with that. However, there’s a compelling reason we can’t ignore them! They view our people as mere experimental subjects. If they were just exploiting us as livestock, we might endure it. But they’re planning to use our people as sacrifices to resurrect the great deity Jilzaridhara! This is wickedness that cannot be overlooked!”</p>
<p id="line_272">Indigenous gods varied greatly, and not all of them were benevolent. Even malevolent powerful spirits could—depending on the circumstances—be worshiped as gods. Likely, the deity Jilzaridhara also had a symbiotic relationship with humanity, harboring its own negative aspects. This speculation was confirmed by Al-san’s reaction.</p>
<p id="line_273">“Who’s that…”</p>
<p id="line_274">It seemed Heinz-san wasn’t fully briefed on this detail. His concern was clearly directed toward managing Echidna’s executives.</p>
<p id="line_275">“If we fail, does that mean this Jil-whatever god will be resurrected? With many victims sacrificed?”</p>
<p id="line_276">“Jilzaridhara is a powerful deity, but whenever one asks for favors, it always demands sacrifices. Traditionally, a thousand sacrifices were required. While it was useful in times of war, it’s unnecessary in today’s world. However, since it’s also conceivable that vicious <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and beasts may descend from the sky, it’s an unsplittable heroic god for us.”</p>
<p id="line_277">The god worshiped in the Kingdom of Grada, now dormant, would not care who provided the sacrifices, as long as it received them.</p>
<p id="line_278">“So, if Echidna provides the sacrifices…”</p>
<p id="line_279">“That’s right. Jilzaridhara would be harnessed by Echidna.”</p>
<p id="line_280">That was the worst-case scenario. It was clear now that the internal issues of the Kingdom of Grada could not be ignored. Remaining on the sidelines was no longer an option.</p>
<p id="line_281">“I have no choice but to do it.”</p>
<p id="line_282">“Hey, hey, Shizu-san. Who are you planning to kill?”</p>
<p id="line_283">I didn’t mean it quite like that, but Heinz-san’s interpretation wasn’t entirely off.</p>
<p id="line_284">“The members of Echidna and anyone who gets in our way.”</p>
<p id="line_285">“Don’t simplify it like that! Weren’t you listening? Do you realize how many enemies we’re up against?!”</p>
<p id="line_286">I didn’t know the exact number, but not everyone would attack simultaneously, and some might not be suited for battle. Overthinking it wasn’t necessary; things would work out somehow. Besides…victory wasn’t solely about numbers but about the quality of strength. If the opponent was unbeatable, even one enemy could make victory impossible.</p>
<p id="line_287">“Everyone, I am well aware of the dangers involved in this mission. Certainly, within my country, we recognize the importance of this matter and have mobilized the knights to counter Edward’s forces. Our plan is to capture the executives of Echidna before they awaken Jilzaridhara. At present, Reinhardt is devising a strategy prioritizing this objective above all else. My task was not only to enlist adventurers within the country but also to seek support from external sources. Most likely, the greatest obstacle will be defeating the executives of Echidna.”</p>
<p id="line_288">The Kingdom of Grada appeared to be doing what was necessary, countering numbers with numbers and quality with quality, focusing on securing personnel capable of opposing the strong. Their caution was warranted because their opponents included Echidna’s executives.</p>
<p id="line_289">“Can you win against an executive, Al-san?”</p>
<p id="line_290">In my estimation, Al-san was quite skilled. Even I found him to be an expert whose presence was hard to read, and judging by his gait, he seemed to be a highly skilled swordsman. If even someone like him was cautious, then we must consider the enemy to be quite formidable.</p>
<p id="line_291">“If the opponent were alone, I might stand a chance. However, that man, Ash, has two bodyguards—a double-blade user and an assassin—alongside him. He himself seems to be a powerful magician, adept at summoning and elemental magic. Honestly, I judged it too tough for me alone. So, I’ve requested reinforcements from neighboring allied countries.”</p>
<p id="line_292">Apparently, that man named Ash was an executive of Echidna. It seemed that spies from the Kingdom of Grada investigated, but several of them were killed by assassins. I was grateful for their valuable information and offered prayers for the souls of those who had passed away. Also, Al held the position of the Third Prince and Captain of the Knights. Although he had requested cooperation from adventurers this time, he said they wanted to resolve the incident themselves if possible. However, they had discovered the presence of formidable enemies that knights alone might not be able to defeat. So he hastily contacted various places to check if there were any renowned adventurers staying there. And that was how they chose me and Fuze-kun for this.</p>
<p id="line_293">“I guess if I hadn’t contacted Shizu-san, it would have turned into a huge problem…”</p>
<p id="line_294">“I’m grateful for your decision, Heinz-dono. No matter how many less skilled individuals we gather, they wouldn’t stand a chance against multiple strong opponents.”</p>
<p id="line_295">Of course, it wouldn’t be meaningless. Humans would tire, so if you surrounded them with enough people, eventually you could win. But doing so would result in an unknown number of casualties. Moreover, if the numbers were lacking, defeat was also possible. As a reliable method, the best course of action was to gather those who could compete against the strong.</p>
<p id="line_296">“I think you did the right thing, Al-san. You were polite enough to ask, but you wanted to seek our help, didn’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_297">“Yes. While it is due to our country’s incompetence, leaving this matter unresolved could cause trouble for the western neighboring countries as well. Swallowing my pride, I humbly ask you. Please, come with me,” Al-san said and bowed his head. I thought his gesture of bowing his head and casting aside his status as a prince of the kingdom was sincere.</p>
<p id="line_298">“Yeah, I understand. Well then, shall we head out right away?”</p>
<p id="line_299">“Hey, hold on, hold on! How about my answer—wait, even before that, I mean, we haven’t even prepared anything yet!”</p>
<p id="line_300">“I’m ready anytime!”</p>
<p id="line_301">“I am too. Shizu-dono, I owe you my utmost gratitude!”</p>
<p id="line_302">“Can we discuss that after the mission is completed?”</p>
<p id="line_303">It looked like Al-san was ready to depart at any time as well. Then we should quickly depart for the Kingdom of Grada.</p>
<p id="line_304">“I said wait! I get it. I’m coming too, so at least give me an hour!”</p>
<p id="line_305">Saying he needed to prepare, Fuze-kun hurriedly left the reception room. I smiled when I saw him like that and thought about how restless Fuze-kun was.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_306">The three of us ran at a good pace toward the Kingdom of Grada. This method was faster than using horses. Al-san mentioned that he had reached the Kingdom of Blumund in less than two days. Should this be expected of him as a knight commander, or was he particularly impressive despite being a prince? At the very least, he seemed to have more stamina than Fuze-kun.</p>
<p id="line_307">“Haa, haa, wait, wait a moment, let me rest. Just a little bit…”</p>
<p id="line_308">I chuckled and said, “Come on, you’ve got to be kidding to whine like that. We’ve only been running for about twenty hours, you know?” But Fuze-kun turned bright red and shouted back at me. “Dumbass! I’m not kidding!”</p>
<p id="line_309">And just like that, he fell to the ground.</p>
<p id="line_310">“Eh, you weren’t kidding?”</p>
<p id="line_311">“Of course not! We haven’t even eaten yet!”</p>
<p id="line_312">“Eh? If you’re hungry, you’ll eat what you’ve brought for yourself, no…?”</p>
<p id="line_313">“No one does that! Why would anyone eat while running?”</p>
<p id="line_314">Strange. I had made Fuze-kun angry. It appeared that there was a bit of a difference in adventurer’s common sense between me and Fuze-kun.</p>
<p id="line_315">“Seems like a problem. How about taking a short break then? Al-san, are you okay with that?”</p>
<p id="line_316">Turning to Al-san, I saw him also panting and sinking to the ground.</p>
<p id="line_317">“A-apologies. But, Shizu-dono. A-at this pace, we might be too exhausted to move once we reach our destination…”</p>
<p id="line_318">“Is that so? We haven’t even been sprinting at full speed yet, so we should be fin—”</p>
<p id="line_319">“Break! Let’s take a break!”</p>
<p id="line_320">If that was what the client said, then I had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p id="line_321">“Got it. Then, how about ten minutes, give or take?”</p>
<p id="line_322">“Hey…”</p>
<p id="line_323">“N-no, it’s quite a fast pace already. We should reach Grada from here in less than half a day. It’s more convenient to arrive at night, and for a proper rest, let’s take a solid ten-hour break to rest our bodies. Fortunately, there’s a water source nearby, and under that large tree, we’ll be fine even if it rains.”</p>
<p id="line_324">And so it was decided. If we could take it this easy, I’d like to treat myself to something delicious while we were at it. So, I started cooking. I took out a pot and—</p>
<p id="line_325">“Hold on. Where did you take that out from?”</p>
<p id="line_326">Just as I thought Fuze-kun had collapsed for good, he came back to life and now looked at my hands, complaining.</p>
<p id="line_327"><em>Where did I get this pot from, you say? Well, that’s obvious.</em></p>
<p id="line_328">“This? I gathered iron sand and Altered it. Handy, isn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_329">“Handy is one word for it…whatever. So, what are you making?”</p>
<p id="line_330">Somehow, it seemed I ended up preparing Fuze-kun’s meal too. It was a rule for everyone to prepare their own meals, but I had also been taught cooking by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. To my surprise, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew about “Japan.” I had tried recreating Japanese cuisine, and most attempts were failures, but there was a successful one. And it was this.</p>
<p id="line_331">“It’s pork miso soup. Even with ingredients that were dried and carried for a while, I can bring them back to a fresh state.”</p>
<p id="line_332">With my ability—the unique skill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Deviant" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—changing the state of ingredients was my specialty. I had extracted moisture to reduce volume, making them easier to carry. Inside my backpack, it was packed with these processed ingredients. Even the pork was aged to its most delicious state.</p>
<p id="line_333">“Will you eat too, Al-san?”</p>
<p id="line_334">“Absolutely!”</p>
<p id="line_335">With that, I quickly got back to cooking.</p>
<p id="line_336">“Hey, isn’t your power a unique skill? Is it okay to use it for something like this?”</p>
<p id="line_337">“Of course it is. Even the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ praised me, saying, ‘You should think of more ways to utilize it!”’</p>
<p id="line_338">“Oh, I see. Well, if that’s the case then…”</p>
<p id="line_339">I was glad Fuze-kun agreed.</p>
<p id="line_340">“Here it is, all done! Here you go!”</p>
<p id="line_341">I Altered a wooden branch into improvised bowls, poured the pork miso soup into them, and handed them over to the two.</p>
<p id="line_342">“O-oh.”</p>
<p id="line_343">“I humbly receive this meal.”</p>
<p id="line_344">The two initially received the bowls nervously, but their faces lit up with smiles when they smelled the aroma. They began eating the pork miso soup with gusto.</p>
<p id="line_345">“Hot! But delicious!”</p>
<p id="line_346">“This is wonderful. It’s an unusual taste, but really delicious.”</p>
<p id="line_347">It seemed making the soup was worth it, given their positive reactions.</p>
<p id="line_348">“There’s plenty for seconds, so eat as much as you like!”</p>
<p id="line_349">I really wanted some onigiri too, but I couldn’t afford to be extravagant. We filled our stomachs with pork miso soup that day.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_350">With our stomachs full, we decided to take a bath after a post-meal break. If there was no time, I would have made do with the everyday magic spell Clean Wash, but psychologically, I wouldn’t feel truly clean. Since we had some time, I decided to heat up a bath and clean myself up. I would also wash my clothes. I was used to these tasks due to frequent travels.</p>
<p id="line_351">“No, no, who takes a bath in the middle of a journey? Do you have no common sense?”</p>
<p id="line_352">“It’s not just water; it’s hot water.”</p>
<p id="line_353">“That’s not the issue here! Wait, how will you manage to heat the water— Oh, right, you could easily do that.”</p>
<p id="line_354">It seemed like Fuze-kun knew that I commanded Ifrit. Indeed, boiling water was quite simple for me. I casually cast a fireball near the water source. I melted the stone to create a glass-like substance to seal it and prevent leaks. With the bathtub prepared, I used a pot to fetch water and filled it up. I dipped my hand into the water to adjust the temperature. In no time at all, the bath was heated.</p>
<p id="line_355">“You’re going to get in too, right? How should we take turns?”</p>
<p id="line_356">“You are being too careless! With two men here, a woman should not be getting undressed!”</p>
<p id="line_357">“Eh? I mean, I’m not going to be naked. I’m wearing underwear and a mask. Besides, with three of us here, we can watch out for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, right?”</p>
<p id="line_358">Since we were traveling, we should stay vigilant against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> no matter the situation. That was obvious for adventurers. That was why I always wore underwear when taking a bath, exercising caution. Of course, that was my intention this time as well. Well, with two strong men keeping watch, I didn’t think we had to worry about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attacks.</p>
<p id="line_359">“That ain’t the point at all!”</p>
<p id="line_360">For some reason, Fuze-kun kept complaining until the end, but eventually, he relented and took a bath.</p>
<p id="line_361">“Just leave your clothes here; I’ll wash them together later.”</p>
<p id="line_362">“Are you my mom or something?!”</p>
<p id="line_363">It seemed that Fuze-kun was in a rebellious phase. In the end, he let me handle the laundry but firmly refused to let me wash his underwear. It was a missed opportunity to change or even wash them… Personally, I’d recommend taking a proper bath and doing the laundry. Al-san also seemed dissatisfied along with Fuze-kun, but after taking a bath, he looked quite content. As expected, a bath felt great. I took my turn last, then took care of the laundry and cleaning up. I made sure to dry the washed clothes properly and handed them back to the two.</p>
<p id="line_364">“T-thanks.”</p>
<p id="line_365">“Thank you. However, experiencing such comfort on a journey is beyond what I’d normally expect. Baths are not something that even inns have at the ready…”</p>
<p id="line_366">I had my complaints about that too. In this world, oddly enough, there were fewer inns with baths. Even if they existed, you typically had to fetch the water yourself and bathe outside the inn or pay an additional fee for hot water.</p>
<p id="line_367"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> used to complain about this as well.</p>
<p id="line_368">‹I’m so grateful to have you around, Shizu›, she always praised me during bath time.</p>
<p id="line_369">The next day, I woke up feeling refreshed. Fully replenished, we departed in high spirits.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_370">We arrived at our destination ahead of schedule, in less than ten hours. Taking enough rest seemed to have paid off. With this, we should be able to make up for any minor delays.</p>
<p id="line_371">“Actually, it’s not like we’re in such dire straits that a two or three-day delay would make a difference. We don’t have the luxury to take it easy, but we still have plenty of time to prepare adequately. Even for Echidna, which has strong organizational capabilities, preparing over a thousand sacrifices won’t be easy. More importantly, about the method of infiltrating the capital—”</p>
<p id="line_372">Normally, even citizens of the Kingdom of Grada needed to go through procedures to enter the capital city. Especially for adventurers not affiliated with the state, strict inspection was required. This inspection could take several days in some cases, but it was unavoidable. Accepting individuals with strength surpassing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on their own was out of the question.</p>
<p id="line_373">In any case, now was not the time to be discussing such leisurely matters. Moreover, there was no guarantee that the second prince’s people wouldn’t be at the reception, so we planned to enter the capital without going through reception. That was precisely why arriving at night was preferable.</p>
<p id="line_374">The current time was around the end of dinner, after eight o’clock. Since we arrived a bit earlier than planned, we decided to discuss our future plans now that we were nearing the capital.</p>
<p id="line_375">“The outer walls of the capital are a little over four meters high. We shouldn’t have much difficulty jumping over them, but doing so might trigger magical alarms and set off alerts. Therefore, we’ll wait for a specific time and then proceed with our infiltration.”</p>
<p id="line_376">That specific time referred to the changeover of the magic personnel. Needless to say, it was a state secret.</p>
<p id="line_377">“Hey, hey, is it really okay to know that? Won’t they kill us later for knowing this?”</p>
<p id="line_378">Mhm, mhm.</p>
<p id="line_379">It seemed like Fuze-kun noticed that too. Judging by his sharp awareness, it seemed Heinz-san’s education was thorough.</p>
<p id="line_380">“Your concern is valid, but please trust me on this. We’ll review this rotation after we’re done with this matter.”</p>
<p id="line_381">“Do that.”</p>
<p id="line_382">With that reassurance, we moved on to the next step.</p>
<p id="line_383">“Once we’re inside the capital, security isn’t as strict. However, both factions stagger their patrols, so let’s stay vigilant and not let our guard down.”</p>
<p id="line_384">“Of course.”</p>
<p id="line_385">“You don’t have to tell me.”</p>
<p id="line_386">“Yes, you’re right. My apologies.”</p>
<p id="line_387">Al-san likely already thought it was going to be fine. Even so, by emphasizing it, it was clear that he had a meticulous personality.</p>
<p id="line_388">Then, Al-san continued with his explanation. First and foremost, we would prioritize meeting up with our allies. Our allies were the first prince’s faction located in the royal castle. We would head to a hideout out of sight, then use the royal family’s secret passage to sneak into the royal castle unnoticed.</p>
<p id="line_389">“For real, though, if we know that, aren’t our lives in serious danger?”</p>
<p id="line_390">“It’s natural to think that. However, this decision is unavoidable for now. There are other secret passages besides this route, so we will consider abandoning it afterward…”</p>
<p id="line_391">Al-san said with a grim expression, emphasizing that trusting him was the only option. It would be better to eliminate anyone who knew the royal family’s secrets to prevent future problems. It seemed Al-san himself was thinking that there would inevitably be someone who thought that way. But the fact that he was making us aware of it already made me feel like we could trust him.</p>
<p id="line_392">“Fuze-kun, let’s trust Al-san here. If we can’t trust our comrade, any strategy is bound to fail.”</p>
<p id="line_393">When I said that, Fuze-kun let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p id="line_394">“Can’t be helped. If you say so, I’ll trust my life to Prince Alfred. You have my trust, Al-san,” Fuze-kun said, making Al-san smile wryly.</p>
<p id="line_395">“Haha, I guess I can only say ‘leave it to me.’ Above all, betraying your expectations would be the hardest thing for me. It’s only been a few days, but I’m honored to be considered your comrade, Shizu-dono. So please, trust me until the end.”</p>
<p id="line_396">With those words, Al-san’s gaze was unwaveringly sincere, and both Fuze-kun and I decided to believe in his words.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" id="story-3" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/title_cards/story-3.png"/></div>
<p class="pagebreak" id="line_397"></p>
<h1 class="ch-number">Story 3</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Shizue Izawa’s Adventuring Life Part 2</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_398">The time had come, and the infiltration operation was carried out.</p>
<p id="line_399">As planned, we swiftly arrived at the hideout and made our way safely to the royal castle. We were then escorted to the reception room, where we were introduced to several key figures.</p>
<p id="line_400">The well-built man with an impressive beard was this country’s first prince, His Highness Reinhardt. Alongside him were the prime minister and the vice captain of the knights. There was also another man who looked exactly like Al-san. This man was the head of the spies of the Kingdom of Grada. For the past few days, he had been publicly acting as Al-san’s double. His disguise techniques were so skillful that it was impossible to tell them apart when they stood side by side. Of course, in combat, their differences would become obvious. These individuals were the key players involved in this operation.</p>
<p id="line_401">“Welcome, Shizue Izawa-dono, the ‘Conqueror of Flames,’ and Fuze-dono, the ‘Gale Swordsman.’ Your exploits are well known in our country. It is truly reassuring to have you on our side.” His Imperial Highness Prince Reinhardt welcomed us on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p id="line_402">Next, Prime Minister-san spoke. “First, allow me to apologize. It is a great disappointment to our nation that we couldn’t assemble a sufficient number of personnel within the limited time for this mission. Unfortunately, the situation is less favorable than we had hoped.” He then began explaining the current situation.</p>
<p id="line_403">Echidna’s activities had intensified, and preparations for the revival of the god were progressing steadily. If the goal was to make the second prince the crown prince, it would be naive to simply appoint the first prince as the successor. Such an action would likely plunge the Kingdom of Grada into civil war.</p>
<p id="line_404">Although information was tightly controlled, it seemed the current king’s health was deteriorating. Reportedly, two-thirds of the nobility in the country had already declared their support for the second prince. If the king were to pass away under these circumstances, a civil war would almost certainly break out, regardless of what else happened.</p>
<p id="line_405"><em>If this were merely a matter of succession, I’d recommend leaving it alone…</em></p>
<p id="line_406">But if the second prince were to ascend to the throne, the revival of Jilzaridhara would become a real threat, leading to catastrophic consequences. To prevent such a scenario, it seemed there was no choice but to cooperate.</p>
<p id="line_407">“So, is this god called Jilzaridhara really likely to be revived?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_408">The Prime Minister’s face twisted with bitterness at my question.</p>
<p id="line_409">“Our country’s cathedral is a historic and revered structure. It can accommodate over a thousand people and is designed with steps so the altar is visible from anywhere. However, it also contains certain mechanisms used for a specific ritual…”</p>
<p id="line_410">Apparently, the backs of the chairs had hidden mechanisms—stakes aimed at the heart and blades for the neck—that could spring out. The altar at the center was positioned at the lowest level. In other words, seated believers could be killed, and their blood would flow down to the altar.</p>
<p id="line_411">“That’s quite an elaborate design…”</p>
<p id="line_412">“I don’t deny it. However, this ritual is believed to bring our prayers directly to God. Those who were dying volunteered for the ritual, convinced they were journeying to God’s realm.”</p>
<p id="line_413">“I can’t agree with that, but now isn’t the time for that discussion. So, what about the answer to my question?”</p>
<p id="line_414">The crucial issue was whether Jilzaridhara would indeed be revived. If the sacrifices had already been gathered in the church, we would have to plan our strategy with the assumption that the revival was imminent. In that case, our chances of success would drop drastically. However, if there were no sacrifices, we could quickly seize control of the church and eliminate Echidna’s executives.</p>
<p id="line_415">Since dealing with the second prince was beyond our jurisdiction, we should leave that matter to the people of this country.</p>
<p id="line_416">“You can rest assured on that front. There shouldn’t be enough sacrifices for the revival of the god. We have our people monitoring closely, and the number of individuals entering and leaving the church hasn’t exceeded a hundred at most.”</p>
<p id="line_417">The head of the spies answered in place of Prime Minister-san.</p>
<p id="line_418"><em>That’s a relief, then.</em></p>
<p id="line_419">“So, our mission is to take down Echidna’s executives—is that correct?”</p>
<p id="line_420">“That’s the request. I’ll manage things at the castle to ensure the nobles don’t interfere. Forgive me for leaving you with such a dangerous task.”</p>
<p id="line_421">Upon hearing His Highness Reinhardt’s words, Fuze-kun and I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_422">It was unthinkable for a royal, especially one being considered for the throne, to participate in a raid operation. It would be more beneficial if he focused on restraining the nobles allied with the second prince’s faction.</p>
<p id="line_423">“The knights will be fully mobilized to confront Edward’s forces and Echidna. The three of us will proceed as planned to eliminate Ash and his group. Does that sound acceptable?”</p>
<p id="line_424">At Al-san’s statement, the vice captain appeared apologetic. Given the circumstances, there was no choice but to leave such formidable enemies to Al-san, which likely made the vice captain feel inadequate. But this was something that couldn’t be helped. In this world, no matter how many weak people there were, they couldn’t defeat the strong.</p>
<p id="line_425">“Yeah, leave it to us. So, who’s taking on whom?”</p>
<p id="line_426">Our targets were the enemy leader, Ash the Magician, along with a dual-blade user and an assassin.</p>
<p id="line_427">As Fuze-kun pointed out, we needed to decide who would face whom.</p>
<p id="line_428">“I’ll take on the dual-blade user. Despite my appearance, my swordsmanship is decent. I’d like to ask Fuze-dono to handle the assassin. While I’m not sure about endurance, the ‘Gale Swordsman’ surely has better burst speed than I do, right?”</p>
<p id="line_429">“That makes sense. Since you’re an elementalist, it’ll be easier for you to take on the magician, right?”</p>
<p id="line_430">Hmm, I think Fuze-kun might be misunderstanding something.</p>
<p id="line_431">Personally, it didn’t matter to me whether I was facing the swordsman, the assassin, or anyone else. Master Claude trained me to counter any opponent, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> drilled me thoroughly in unorthodox techniques.</p>
<p id="line_432">Looking back, despite being the great “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had an unexpectedly cautious side. Coupled with her immense abilities, it was easy to understand why she was considered the strongest.</p>
<p id="line_433">I should take a cue from her and work harder to become stronger myself.</p>
<p id="line_434">“Got it. So, we’ll defeat our own targets first, then assist the others as needed. Sounds good?” I proposed.</p>
<p id="line_435">Al-san and Fuze-kun nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_436">“Hmm, as expected. Such impressive confidence,” Al-san remarked.</p>
<p id="line_437">“Is that a challenge? Fine by me. I’ll prove that you’re a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the past,” Fuze-kun retorted, still seeming to doubt my abilities.</p>
<p id="line_438">I sighed, realizing that merely running long distances wouldn’t convince him of my strength, but there was no helping it.</p>
<p id="line_439">“Fuze-kun, you worry too much. I won’t lose to younger folks, so rest assured—”</p>
<p id="line_440">“Tch, it’s not about that!” he snapped, raising his voice.</p>
<p id="line_441">It seemed Fuze-kun was embarrassed. He was probably concerned because he thought my strength was declining. Ever since I assimilated with Ifrit, I hadn’t felt any physical decline. I tended to forget, but I wasn’t much younger than Heinz-san, who was about to retire. I might be younger than Fuze-kun’s mother, but from his perspective as a young person, we probably seemed similar in age.</p>
<p id="line_442">“Thank you for worrying about me. But I’ll be fine. I’ll make sure not to let my guard down.”</p>
<p id="line_443">Indeed, it was essential not to let your guard down. And if, despite that vigilance, I still lost to the enemy, it would simply mean I couldn’t win, no matter how hard I tried. In other words, it would mean I was weak, and I would have to accept that fact rather than regret it.</p>
<p id="line_444">“Heh, I see. Well, don’t worry. No matter how much you struggle, I’ll quickly handle things and lend you a hand,” Fuze-kun replied with a grin.</p>
<p id="line_445">“I wouldn’t want you to forget about me either,” Al-san added, echoing Fuze-kun’s sentiment with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_446">They were reliable people.</p>
<p id="line_447">“Agreed. Let’s do our best so we can all return safely,” I said.</p>
<p id="line_448">And with that, the plan was set. Now, all that remained was the execution date, but everyone seemed exhausted from the past few days of sleepless nights. Even if we went to bed now, there was a sense that executing the plan the next day would be tough.</p>
<p id="line_449">“We will also prepare ourselves. During that time, please rest as much as you can,” Prime Minister-san suggested.</p>
<p id="line_450">We decided to accept his proposal. As a result, the execution date was set for the early morning two days later.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_451">Ash, one of Echidna’s executives, sat across from Edward, the second prince of the Kingdom of Grada, his smile deepening. He swirled the wine in his glass, savoring its rich aroma, and let the liquid roll over his tongue.</p>
<p id="line_452">His mind raced with memories of the hardships he had endured until now. Over a decade of Echidna’s covert operations flashed through his mind—establishing roots in this land, earning trust. All of it was to gain control of this country. No, that wasn’t quite it. The true objective was…</p>
<p id="line_453">“So, when will I be able to seize the throne?” Edward’s nervous voice tactlessly interrupted Ash’s reverie.</p>
<p id="line_454">Suppressing his irritation, Ash maintained his smile and replied to Edward.</p>
<p id="line_455">“The operation is proceeding smoothly, thanks to Your Highness’s support. Please continue to assist us. Now, regarding Your Highness’s coronation…”</p>
<p id="line_456">Ash paused, his expression twisting as if something troubling had come to mind.</p>
<p id="line_457">“What is it? Speak quickly,” Edward demanded, his irritation growing.</p>
<p id="line_458">Waiting for just the right moment, Ash resumed speaking.</p>
<p id="line_459">“Understood. I’ve received a report from my spy in the palace indicating troubling activity among the First Prince’s faction.”</p>
<p id="line_460">“My brother, huh? An eyesore of a man, but he’s just resisting the inevitable. He still doesn’t understand the current situation.”</p>
<p id="line_461">“That’s correct, Your Highness. If your brother were to bow his head and submit to you, we would gladly welcome him into our ranks. However, since he remains hostile, we cannot afford to overlook him.”</p>
<p id="line_462">“So, what is my brother up to?”</p>
<p id="line_463">“It seems he intends to seek support from other countries. A messenger has already been sent out.”</p>
<p id="line_464">Upon hearing that, Edward chuckled dismissively.</p>
<p id="line_465">“Support? Ridiculous. What kind of fool would involve themselves in another country’s succession disputes? Blumund lacks the strength to bring our country under its sway. And as for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they have no reason to absorb our country. For them, where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is the state religion, merging with our country, which has many non-believers, would likely be more trouble than it’s worth.”</p>
<p id="line_466">Edward’s judgment was correct.</p>
<p id="line_467">The Kingdom of Grada was an unattractive nation for others to send reinforcements to—but that was about to change.</p>
<p id="line_468">If Edward became king, he would establish connections with the Eastern Empire through Echidna. Until now, those efforts had been obstructed by the powerful nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but with his ascension, they would be able to trade more freely. Of course, to achieve that, new trade routes would need to be opened, and he had already devised a viable plan for this purpose.</p>
<p id="line_469">By relying on the great power of the god Jilzaridhara, Edward could even impose demands on the great nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. To achieve these ambitions, the necessary sacrifices were to be made by purchasing slaves from Echidna.</p>
<p id="line_470">“Father and even my brother lack ambition! What’s wrong with a king desiring to expand his realm?!” Edward declared boldly.</p>
<p id="line_471">A life spent in the shadow of an exceptional older brother, unnoticed and unacknowledged by anyone. This frustration festered in Edward’s heart, growing larger with the delusions that Ash had so carefully nurtured.</p>
<p id="line_472">Edward was now nothing more than Ash’s puppet, though he remained completely unaware of it.</p>
<p id="line_473">While secretly mocking Edward, Ash skillfully manipulated him on the surface. Although Edward had become obedient to Ash, his higher status meant that causing his displeasure could jeopardize Ash’s future plans. Therefore, Ash carefully chose his words when dealing with him.</p>
<p id="line_474">“I thought they were being careless, but it seems their goal isn’t to influence other countries.”</p>
<p id="line_475">“What?” Edward asked, intrigued.</p>
<p id="line_476">“They seem intent on hiring famous adventurers to target us. It’s like they don’t know their place, or rather, they’re being foolish.”</p>
<p id="line_477">“Haha…hahaha! How foolish. Adventurers? What can vermin like them possibly do? Even if they bring a few of those trash along, it’s just a matter of disposing of them as usual. My brother really lacks any significant intelligence, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p id="line_478">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, exactly. Leave it to me to take care of that,” Ash replied with a smirk.</p>
<p id="line_479">What Ash failed to account for was that Alfred was a cautious man and that the chief spy loyal to the royal family was a master of disguise. These two factors led to him overlooking Alfred’s departure from the country as a messenger. This proved to be a fatal oversight, allowing Shizue Izawa, a powerful ally of Reinhardt’s faction, to intervene.</p>
<p id="line_480">Unaware of this, Ash dismissed the possibility that a few skilled individuals could cause any real problems and didn’t reconsider his plans. However, he didn’t forget to take precautions, just in case. It was this vigilance that had elevated a man like Ash to a position among Echidna’s executives.</p>
<p id="line_481">Edward casually nodded toward Ash and said, “Yeah, do as you please. So, how’s Alfred? Still not willing to follow me?”</p>
<p id="line_482">“It’s a deadlock, I’m afraid. Alfred-sama dislikes sibling rivalry and has joined the knights to maintain a neutral stance. However, the knights swear loyalty to the royal family. If His Majesty the King were to designate the Crown Prince as his successor—”</p>
<p id="line_483">Even if this were whispered in private and not openly stated, it could still be enough to push Alfred to support Reinhardt. Although it had not been confirmed, Ash couldn’t completely rule out the possibility of such a move. He worried that this issue might become a concern.</p>
<p id="line_484">And indeed, within the royal palace, the situation was unfolding exactly as Ash had feared.</p>
<p id="line_485">“That is unlikely. Father is merely waiting for his death at this point. Surely he understands the consequences of making a foolish move at this stage, without anyone needing to tell him.”</p>
<p id="line_486">“Indeed. However, even if Alfred-sama were to side with the Crown Prince, we have gathered enough forces to handle it. It would lead to civil war, but I would ask for your forgiveness in that case.”</p>
<p id="line_487">“…There’s no helping it. If that time comes, Alfred will become a cornerstone of this country. But truth be told, I don’t wish to burn down the capital of this kingdom, which is destined to be mine, with my own hands.”</p>
<p id="line_488">At that moment, neither of them doubted that their ambitions would be fulfilled. The operation was nearing its climax, and whether it was the king’s death or the completion of the preparations that would come first, they held the reins of control.</p>
<p id="line_489">That was why they didn’t anticipate the enemy making a move first. If that happened, a civil war would erupt in the small country. In a sense, they trusted the enemy to avoid such a foolish choice, believing in the sensibility of the Crown Prince.</p>
<p id="line_490">And then, the next day, they would come to realize their miscalculation.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_491">The knights, concealed in the darkness of night, were stationed at various points around the town. At sunrise, they began their operation, evacuating the awakened citizens from the designated battleground areas.</p>
<p id="line_492">A hundred knights, one-third of the order, were involved in this operation. Another hundred were stationed at the royal palace under Prince Reinhardt’s command, tasked with arresting nobles who sided with Prince Edward. Meanwhile, we were set to storm the cathedral with an elite hundred knights. The signal for the start of the operation had just been given.</p>
<p id="line_493">“Charge!”</p>
<p id="line_494">At Al-san’s command, everyone surged forward all at once.</p>
<p id="line_495">“E-enemy attack!”</p>
<p id="line_496">The enemy was not foolish. Upon hearing the sentry’s shout, their counterattack unit sprang into action.</p>
<p id="line_497">This was the beginning of a civil war, but the enemy likely had only a few of the country’s own forces. They probably had reinforcements from the massive organization known as Echidna.</p>
<p id="line_498">The battlefield was the cathedral. Although we were told the enemy numbered less than a hundred, we couldn’t afford to be careless. The cathedral was their stronghold, and we had no idea what traps might be set there.</p>
<p id="line_499">Even now, several knights fell simultaneously. Stakes shot out from the chairs, piercing the legs and sides of the passing knights. I had heard these were traps designed for harvesting sacrificial lives, but I hadn’t realized they could be used in this manner. Although most of the knights were protected by their armor, a stake to the neck could be fatal.</p>
<p id="line_500">“Don’t let your guard down! Magic squad, hit the enemy with fireballs and clear the obstacles!”</p>
<p id="line_501">In response to Al-san’s command, the sorcerers of the knight order launched fireballs.</p>
<p id="line_502">Roaring explosions and blazing flames engulfed the cathedral. Hidden enemy soldiers emerged from the chaos.</p>
<p id="line_503">The melee began. Swords clashed, and shouts of anger filled the air. The raging flames were quickly subdued by the intensity of the battle on both sides.</p>
<p id="line_504">Ignoring the tumult around us, we charged straight through the cathedral.</p>
<p id="line_505">Knights who had finished evacuating the citizens would surround the area around the cathedral. We couldn’t allow the ringleaders to escape; if they got outside, those knights would have to deal with them, which could escalate the damage. Now was not the time to worry about the chaos within.</p>
<p id="line_506">“I’ll leave the rest to you!”</p>
<p id="line_507">Al-san entrusted the scene to the vice captain and followed us. As planned, we headed towards the altar, where we suspected the target was hiding behind a door.</p>
<p id="line_508">Then, a figure appeared on the altar.</p>
<p id="line_509">“Alfred, I am disappointed in you!”</p>
<p id="line_510">The voice came from someone who closely resembled Al-san. This person was likely Prince Edward.</p>
<p id="line_511">Though Prince Edward was reputed to excel in strategy, he seemed lacking in combat skills. Despite his lower threat level, he still needed to be apprehended as the mastermind behind this civil war.</p>
<p id="line_512">“My, my. Just as the plan was about to succeed, there’s this unanticipated interference. I never imagined you’d deceive us and ally with the first prince. Still, I must commend your caution,” the pompous robed man said, addressing Al-san.</p>
<p id="line_513">This man must be Ash, one of Echidna’s executives.</p>
<p id="line_514">The eyes visible behind the robe seemed slimy and unpleasant, almost snake-like in nature. I felt uneasy about judging someone based solely on intuition, but Ash definitely gave off a villainous aura.</p>
<p id="line_515">“You know, I don’t just memorize the faces and names of my subordinates, but also their hobbies and preferences. I speak to those on duty every day and watch for anything unusual. That’s how I noticed when one of my subordinates began acting strangely and realized something was wrong.”</p>
<p id="line_516">“So, you figured out our involvement then?”</p>
<p id="line_517">“Exactly. I didn’t like their methods and judged they weren’t fit to be on our side.”</p>
<p id="line_518">“Ku-ku-ku, how cheeky.”</p>
<p id="line_519">“Brother! I have something to say to you as well!”</p>
<p id="line_520">“What is it?”</p>
<p id="line_521">“I ask that you sever ties with such suspicious individuals and surrender. You can then appeal directly to Father and Brother Reinhardt—”</p>
<p id="line_522">“You fool. Your naivety is truly unfit for royalty! Now that things have escalated this far, someone must take responsibility. Even if I were to surrender, I wouldn’t escape the death penalty. So, unless you stand by me, reconciliation is out of the question!”</p>
<p id="line_523">“Kuh, then there’s no choice. With this sword, let me show you and make you come to your senses!”</p>
<p id="line_524">Negotiations had collapsed. This was an expected outcome.</p>
<p id="line_525">And so, we found ourselves plunged into battle without further ado.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_526">Perhaps they underestimated me, as an assassin attacked from the shadows. However, their movements were completely exposed by my <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. With composure, I dodged the knife thrust and kicked the assassin toward Fuze-kun.</p>
<p id="line_527">“It’s a common tactic to target those who seem weaker, but for some reason, I just can’t forgive you right now.”</p>
<p id="line_528">Next, a dual-sword wielder charged at me, but Al-san intervened. “I shall be your opponent.”</p>
<p id="line_529">Prince Edward, maintaining his dignified posture, chose to step back and observe from a distance. Whether he had the ability to sense danger or was simply uncomfortable with rough situations, his retreat was understandable. Well, since it didn’t matter if he lived or not, his safety was not a concern.</p>
<p id="line_530">I decided to focus on my own opponent.</p>
<p id="line_531">Confronting the enemy leader, I noticed that Ash, unlike a typical magician, wore a fearless smile.</p>
<p id="line_532">“What’s the matter? Surprised to see me unprotected and unchanting? From what I gather, you’re a swordsman. May I ask your name?”</p>
<p id="line_533">“Shizue Izawa.”</p>
<p id="line_534">“Shizue Izawa… Shizue, you say?! I can’t believe I have the honor of meeting the renowned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_535">It seemed Ash was familiar with my name. His previously relaxed demeanor shifted to one of visible caution.</p>
<p id="line_536">“Have you decided to surrender obediently?”</p>
<p id="line_537">If he chose to surrender, I personally had no intention of taking his life. Given the gravity of his offenses—which seemed to amount to subversion—a death penalty seemed inevitable, but he might be given a chance to reflect on his actions before the sentence was carried out.</p>
<p id="line_538">However, Ash scoffed at my words. “Foolish. If I were to accept that proposal and get caught, there might be a chance for a plea bargain. But if all I need to do is survive, there’s a simpler and surer way. And that is to kill all of you!”</p>
<p id="line_539">In response to Ash’s declaration, three individuals clad in robes attacked me from behind.</p>
<p id="line_540">These weren’t Ash’s guards that Al-san and Fuze-kun were fighting; they seemed to be newcomers not mentioned in the intel. It was surprising that all three were quite small in stature, but their movements were formidable and couldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p id="line_541">I calmly evaded and positioned myself to handle all four opponents, including Ash. The three seemed tougher than anticipated. With Ash’s offensive magic added to the mix, even I would struggle. I needed to resolve this quickly or risk being overwhelmed.</p>
<p id="line_542">Seemingly sensing my anxiety, Ash burst into laughter. “You shouldn’t underestimate those three, ‘Conqueror of Flames.’ They might be failures, but they serve well enough as my meat shields. Now, go all out and finish off that woman!”</p>
<p id="line_543">The latter part of his statement was directed at the three individuals. In response to Ash’s command, the three discarded their robes and attacked with renewed speed. However, there was something even more surprising. Those three were actually children.</p>
<p id="line_544">“—Children?”</p>
<p id="line_545">“That’s right. But don’t underestimate them. They’re just like you, after all.”</p>
<p id="line_546"><em>Just like me?</em></p>
<p id="line_547">I was deeply curious about what that meant. Ash’s earlier mention of “failures” only heightened my anxiety.</p>
<p id="line_548">“—me.”</p>
<p id="line_549">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_550">One of the three, a girl who approached me directly, murmured something. When I instinctively asked her to clarify, this time there was a clear plea.</p>
<p id="line_551">“Kill me!”</p>
<p id="line_552">Upon hearing that desperate cry, I involuntarily froze. A searing pain shot through my side. Seizing the moment of my vulnerability, the other two children moved in.</p>
<p id="line_553">“Hahahaha! So the rumors of your soft-heartedness were true. It seems there’s an unexpected advantage in dealing with a pushover like you, even for these failures.”</p>
<p id="line_554">Ash’s laughter was sickening. The pain in my side was nothing compared to how irritating his mockery was.</p>
<p id="line_555">“I’m sorry. I-I didn’t want to do this—”</p>
<p id="line_556">The child who had stabbed me was crying, his voice trembling.</p>
<p id="line_557">“No, I hate this! This is just, just awful…”</p>
<p id="line_558">“We can’t disobey orders. So please, kill us.”</p>
<p id="line_559">“We’re not going to live long anyway. I heard failures like us who couldn’t gain power don’t get to live long.”</p>
<p id="line_560">“So please don’t worry about it,” the children pleaded.</p>
<p id="line_561">Even as they spoke, their actions didn’t cease. Their physical abilities were impressive, surpassing those of Al-san and Fuze-kun, but their movements lacked the finesse of trained combatants. They relied on raw strength and coordination rather than technique. Initially, I was taken aback, but their technique was no match for me.</p>
<p id="line_562">The children continued to cry as they fought. Ash, meanwhile, cast strengthening magic on them and scolded them harshly. “Hurry up and finish her off! You worthless shits!”</p>
<p id="line_563">The situation was unpleasant, but I chose to ignore him for now.</p>
<p id="line_564">There was no falsehood in the children’s words. They were simply being manipulated by Ash. And as I observed them, I couldn’t shake a troubling suspicion about these children.</p>
<p id="line_565">“Summoning technique—?”</p>
<p id="line_566">“Kukuku, you’ve figured it out. That’s right. Those brats are just like you, weapons summoned from ‘another world.’ They have the drawback of breaking down easily, but they’re quite useful in their own way.”</p>
<p id="line_567">“Could this technique possibly be…?”</p>
<p id="line_568">“Hm? Yes, that’s correct.” Ash sneered with an ugly smirk. “You’re just like them, aren’t you? Summoned as a weapon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono?” Ash added and laughed out loud. “Gyahahaha!”</p>
<p id="line_569">It was sickening. But right now—</p>
<p id="line_570">The children were being pushed beyond their limits by Ash’s orders. They had already surpassed the effects of the strengthening magic and their physical limits. Now, their internal magicule levels were rising uncontrollably, pushing them into a state of rampage. Their bodies were beginning to break down, and once it reached this point, even recovery magic wouldn’t be able to help them. Saving them was no longer an option—</p>
<p id="line_571">“What’s wrong, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! Can’t do a thing? That’s right. Those brats have been enhanced by my magic to be stronger than even high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. For a has-been like you, all that’s left is to run and hide!”</p>
<p id="line_572">Despite Ash’s taunts, I ignored him and focused on the children. All I could do was one thing.</p>
<p id="line_573">“I shall grant your wish.”</p>
<p id="line_574">Apologizing silently in my heart, I wrapped my sword in flames. It was the only way I could free them from their suffering, the best I could do for them at that moment.</p>
<p id="line_575">I swung my sword.</p>
<p id="line_576">“Thank you.”</p>
<p id="line_577">Again.</p>
<p id="line_578">“You have my gratitude.”</p>
<p id="line_579">And once more.</p>
<p id="line_580">“Don’t cry. We won’t have to suffer anymore—”</p>
<p id="line_581">I held my sword up in front of Ash. Sentimentality would have to wait until it was all over. That was the golden rule for survival and common sense for adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_582">“Th-this is absurd…”</p>
<p id="line_583">“You have angered me.”</p>
<p id="line_584"><em>I will never forgive you.</em> I glared at Ash with that intent.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_585">Even behind my mask, I couldn’t conceal my intent to kill. Ash sensed my anger and briefly showed a hint of fear, but he quickly regained his composure and smirked again.</p>
<p id="line_586">“Excellent. I’ll give you credit for that, ‘Conqueror of Flames.’ Your skill is impressive beyond what I heard, but it doesn’t change my advantage.”</p>
<p id="line_587">What Ash was basing his confidence on was unclear, but it seemed he still had an ace up his sleeve. But it didn’t matter. No matter what he had, I would not forgive him.</p>
<p id="line_588">“Hey, Ash! Are you going to be okay? If you lose, what will happen to me?!”</p>
<p id="line_589">Realizing the tide was turning against him, Prince Edward started to complain to Ash. Although it seemed disrespectful to speak of royalty this way, his demeanor was quite undignified. Yet, what Ash did next was truly appalling, even to me.</p>
<p id="line_590">“My, my, I didn’t expect to be pushed this far, but having Your Highness here has been quite helpful.”</p>
<p id="line_591">“Hm? Hmm, well I suppose so. As long as I’m here, the knights can handle anyth—huh?”</p>
<p id="line_592">Ash, who had approached the unsuspecting Prince Edward, suddenly stabbed him in the chest with a knife he had discreetly drawn.</p>
<p id="line_593">“W-what are you—Guhaaa!”</p>
<p id="line_594">On the altar, Prince Edward staggered and fell. His blood flowed, streaming down onto the altar. No, not just His Highness’s blood, but also the blood of those who had died in the cathedral, mingled and flowed into the altar.</p>
<p id="line_595">“Hmph! Only the royal family of this country can become vessels for Jilzaridhara. It was wise to take this fool in, just in case.”</p>
<p id="line_596">With those words, Ash kicked the fallen Prince Edward.</p>
<p id="line_597">“Kha-how dare you bketray—”</p>
<p id="line_598">With tears of frustration staining his face, Prince Edward murmured his final words. Pitiable, but it was what he had brought upon himself.</p>
<p id="line_599">“Ha-ha-ha! Now, Jilzaridhara! I’ve prepared a body for you. Awaken from your slumber and heed my words!”</p>
<p id="line_600">It seemed Ash intended to command a god. I didn’t think he could pull off such a stunt, but I had no intention of standing by and watching silently.</p>
<p id="line_601">“Relying on uncontrollable immense power will only lead to unfortunate outcomes.”</p>
<p id="line_602">Yes—just like how I ended up killing Pirino.</p>
<p id="line_603">“Nonsense. It claims to be a god, but it’s merely a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bound by mutual interest! Research shows it obeys any command if provided with sacrifices. And with enough sacrifices to awaken, there’s no need to pay in full upfront. First, I shall offer you to Jilzaridhara! Gyahaha!”</p>
<p id="line_604">As if to prove Ash’s words, the body of the presumed deceased Prince Edward began to twitch and pulse.</p>
<p id="line_605">—And thus, the god awakened.</p>
<p id="line_606">‹Did you call for me?›</p>
<p id="line_607">At this point, there was barely any trace of Prince Edward left, not even his face. His physique had expanded and morphed into something demonically muscular. From that body, an immense <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was emitted, hinting at a power far greater than the combined strength of the children from earlier. He was the real deal. Of all the foes I’d encountered thus far, none had been as strong as this entity called Jilzaridhara. Yet, I did not feel afraid. Because I knew of an entity stronger than Jilzaridhara.</p>
<p id="line_608">“Oh, God! Hear my plea. In exchange, I offer the lives of all present here unto thee!”</p>
<p id="line_609">‹Very well. I shall hear your plea.›</p>
<p id="line_610">Ash, who had been prostrating himself after hearing the god’s response, now twisted his face in delight and turned towards me.</p>
<p id="line_611">“Your end is here! Will you grovel before a god in a pitiful plea? It’s futile! Thrash about in disgrace and entertain me. Watching a strong one being trampled is the greatest amusement, no matter how many times I see it!”</p>
<p id="line_612">With his twisted desire unabashedly revealed, Ash continued to laugh raucously.</p>
<p id="line_613">It was sickening.</p>
<p id="line_614">Ash’s laughter was grating and offensive.</p>
<p id="line_615"><em>Enough—I will not endure this any longer.</em></p>
<p id="line_616">If the children’s blood was used to resurrect a god, I would burn away that life completely. After all, I didn’t think those children ever wished for the resurrection of a god.</p>
<p id="line_617">I wouldn’t let even a god disturb those children’s peaceful rest.</p>
<p id="line_618">“Shi-Shizu-dono! This is getting dangerous. We can’t handle a god!”</p>
<p id="line_619">“He’s right. Let’s retreat for now and regroup with the others at the royal castle—”</p>
<p id="line_620">They might have defeated their respective opponents since Al-san and Fuze-kun came over to my side. They witnessed the godly Jilzaridhara and seemed to realize what was happening. They hurried to bring me back, but my resolve had already been set.</p>
<p id="line_621">Above all else, I was furious from the depths of my heart.</p>
<p id="line_622">“I will stay here and defeat that thing. You all should escape first and help the survivors.”</p>
<p id="line_623">“Hah? What are you saying at a time like thi—”</p>
<p id="line_624">“Fuze, obey my words.”</p>
<p id="line_625">“Wha?!”</p>
<p id="line_626"><em>Sorry for being disrespectful, okay?</em> But for a disobedient child, this was the most effective approach.</p>
<p id="line_627">“Let’s go, Fuze-dono. Let’s leave this to Shizu-dono.”</p>
<p id="line_628">“Y-yeah. Sh-Shizu-san, you won’t die, right?”</p>
<p id="line_629"><em>Who knows, I can’t promise that.</em> However, to reassure Fuze-kun, I removed my mask and gave him a comforting smile.</p>
<p id="line_630">“…!”</p>
<p id="line_631">“I’ll do my best not to die. So, please take care of this—it’s something important.”</p>
<p id="line_632">“I-I understand.”</p>
<p id="line_633">Fuze-kun took the mask from my hand and cradled it carefully against his chest. Then, prompted by Al-san, he moved away from the scene.</p>
<p id="line_634">“Hahahaha! There’s no escape. Now that the god has revived, all of you will be slaughtered!”</p>
<p id="line_635">“Is that so? Then why aren’t you running away?”</p>
<p id="line_636">“Huh? Why would I need to run aw—guagh!”</p>
<p id="line_637">Ah, as I thought. Ash was swiftly dispatched.</p>
<p id="line_638">When negotiating with a superior entity, it was crucial to choose your words with utmost caution. Supernatural entities often twist our words to suit their own convenience. Ash’s earlier words were practically a request to be killed, so this outcome was completely expected.</p>
<p id="line_639"><em>I wanted to eliminate the man named Ash myself, but I let you, who claims to be a god, handle it this time. So, Jilzaridhara-san, I want you to receive my anger.</em></p>
<p id="line_640">“Wake up—Ifrit—”</p>
<p id="line_641">Flames enveloped my body. The power that had been restrained by the mask was now unleashed.</p>
<p id="line_642">‹What, a spirit? How dare a feeble higher spirit like you interfere with a god!›</p>
<p id="line_643">Jilzaridhara launched a punch toward me, brimming with destructive power. However, I remained unfazed.</p>
<p id="line_644">The flames surrounding my body consumed each and every cell, converting them into pure energy. The burns had transformed into patterns resembling flames, spreading across my entire body beneath my clothes. This was evidence of my Harmonization with Ifrit.</p>
<p id="line_645">Just as Jilzaridhara’s punch was about to make contact, my body distorted and vanished like a mirage.</p>
<p id="line_646">‹What?! Is this… Harmonization with a spirit? No, it can’t be—›</p>
<p id="line_647">For a supposed god, he seemed quite surprised.</p>
<p id="line_648">Even though I was Shizu now, I was not merely that existence alone. I had fully assimilated with the Raging Flame Giant, becoming the “Conqueror of Flames.”</p>
<p id="line_649">I had always lived while suppressing Ifrit’s power, but now, I was releasing all of it. Burning with this anger, I sought even greater power. I sensed Ifrit’s momentary confusion, but it quickly vanished, replaced by a sense of jubilation.</p>
<p id="line_650">Perfect harmony—feeling this good, I might even thank Jilzaridhara for it. But I had no intention of forgiving.</p>
<p id="line_651">I raised my sword and declared, “You spread misfortune. There’s no need for a god like you.”</p>
<p id="line_652">There was no such thing as god in this world. If there were, they should have granted my wish.</p>
<p id="line_653">‹Silence! How dare a lower being like you speak words denying a god!›</p>
<p id="line_654">Indeed, this was no true god. Then, there was no need for restraint. I would use all my strength to eradicate this so-called god, a source of misfortune. Resolved to fight, I transformed into the embodiment of fire and launched my assault on Jilzaridhara—</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_655">That battle was nothing short of absurd. Hiding behind debris from the collapsed ceiling, Fuze and Alfred observed Shizu closely.</p>
<p id="line_656">“W-wow…”</p>
<p id="line_657">“I never expected Shizu-dono to be so incredibly strong…”</p>
<p id="line_658">Both of them were rendered speechless and completely captivated by the battle.</p>
<p id="line_659">No, One could say they were completely enthralled by Shizu’s beauty. The moment Fuze saw her true face, he was struck with a shock as if his heart had been pierced. A delicate, ephemeral, gentle, fair-skinned, and ethereal beauty. Despite being close to his mother’s age, Shizu appeared as a young girl, still youthful. That was Shizu, the woman in question.</p>
<p id="line_660">Fuze didn’t remember, but apparently, he had been held by her when he was young. Heinz, Fuze’s father, told him that he used to bury his face in Shizu’s chest and be overjoyed, often teasing him about it. Embarrassed by this, Fuze had acted rebelliously towards Shizu…</p>
<p id="line_661"><em>Damn it, I’m such a fool! Why can’t I remember that sensation!</em> With these self-directed complaints, Fuze’s heart was filled with regret.</p>
<p id="line_662">He then recalled his attitude towards Shizu, cursing his actions while thinking to himself, “baka, baka, baka, baka,” reflecting on his behavior.</p>
<p id="line_663">“How beautiful. From Fuze-dono’s attitude, I had assumed she was much older.”</p>
<p id="line_664">“No, you’re not wrong, but maybe she doesn’t age at all. In the ‘other world,’ it seems there are people with such unique constitutions.”</p>
<p id="line_665">“Hmm, is that so?”</p>
<p id="line_666">“Probably.”</p>
<p id="line_667">Fuze and Alfred found themselves more engrossed in discussing Shizu’s story than the outcome of the battle, which would decide their own fates. In a way, they were both true to their instincts.</p>
<p id="line_668">As they watched, the battle reached its climax. Jilzaridhara’s fierce attacks assaulted Shizu, but she perfectly anticipated and skillfully countered every one of them. No matter how powerful the attacks were, they were meaningless if they didn’t connect. Shizu’s masterful maneuvering was a lesson in itself.</p>
<p id="line_669">Moreover, although Shizu’s attacks weren’t one-hit kills, they steadily wore down Jilzaridhara’s stamina. Having just awakened, with their power not fully restored and not yet fully attuned to their vessel, Jilzaridhara couldn’t consider Shizu a weak opponent.</p>
<p id="line_670">‹Impossible, to think that just by absorbing the power of a higher spirit—›</p>
<p id="line_671">“You’re mistaken. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have been able to unleash this much power.”</p>
<p id="line_672">As Shizu spoke, her sword inflicted a small wound on Jilzaridhara. Flames burst forth from the wound, spreading the damage wider and wider.</p>
<p id="line_673">‹Annoying, insolent! But, I don’t understand. Against my attributes, flames should hold no superiority whatsoever. And yet, what is this?!›</p>
<p id="line_674">The current situation was extremely undesirable for Jilzaridhara. They had been injured by an opponent they had tried to crush like a mere insect. Moreover, it seemed that against an opponent they thought they could easily defeat, they were now being pushed back. Jilzaridhara still had enough discernment to realize this.</p>
<p id="line_675">“Oh, you’re a god, and you didn’t notice? I used my power to change your attribute. It didn’t completely take away your superiority, but it successfully neutralized your advantage.”</p>
<p id="line_676">Shizu dropped this bombshell on the increasingly anxious Jilzaridhara. She had changed the attribute of a god to allow her fire to pass through. Shizu certainly claimed that.</p>
<p id="line_677">‹Impossible! There’s no way you could pull off such a stunt!›</p>
<p id="line_678">Jilzaridhara roared in outrage, shouting, “Don’t joke around!”</p>
<p id="line_679">While Jilzaridhara claimed to be a god, they were not a true ‘god’ in the literal sense. Their true identity was that of a fallen angel who had transformed into a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, gaining power surpassing even that of run-of-the-mill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, considered to be among the strongest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, would be nothing more than fodder to Jilzaridhara. Whether they had just been resurrected or not, the situation remained the same.</p>
<p id="line_680">Moreover—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were strong against angels, angels were strong against spirits, and spirits were strong against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. For Jilzaridhara, a former angel, an elementalist was supposed to be no enemy at all. That was supposed to be the case…</p>
<p id="line_681">He was not a true god, but neither was he someone who would lose to the likes of Ifrit. Besides, the flames of a spirit shouldn’t have any effect. However, now Shizu’s fire was scorching Jilzaridhara’s body.</p>
<p id="line_682">‹Did you really change my attribute—?›</p>
<p id="line_683">“That’s what I said, didn’t I? Even though you claim to be a god, you can’t distinguish truth from lies. I see through you. You’re a fake.”</p>
<p id="line_684">Shizu now completely understood Jilzaridhara’s power. When she used her unique skill, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Deviant" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, to Alter Jilzaridhara’s attributes and make her flame power effective, she realized that Jilzaridhara had the attributes of an angel. Although Jilzaridhara’s stored magicules far exceeded Shizu’s, she understood that their Level was lower. That was why Shizu felt confident she could secure victory by continuing her steady assault.</p>
<p id="line_685">‹Don’t underestimate me!›</p>
<p id="line_686">“That should be my line.”</p>
<p id="line_687">Dodging Jilzaridhara’s wild, anger-fueled punch, Shizu swiftly slashed with her sword. The blade gleamed red, severing Jilzaridhara’s arm.</p>
<p id="line_688">‹Ugh?!›</p>
<p id="line_689">Jilzaridhara’s eyes widened in astonishment.</p>
<p id="line_690">It was only then that they realized they were being driven into a corner.</p>
<p id="line_691">“Are you ready? If you’re a god, then show me you can withstand this attack.”</p>
<p id="line_692">‹N-no, stop!›</p>
<p id="line_693">“I won’t forgive you. You’ve angered me.”</p>
<p id="line_694">‹You’re mistaken! It wasn’t I who angered you, but that puny human.›</p>
<p id="line_695">“No, you’re wrong. If it weren’t for you, this disaster wouldn’t have happened.”</p>
<p id="line_696">Thinking those words were unreasonable, Jilzaridhara felt a human-like emotion, though it seemed unlikely to sway Shizu. At that moment, the tables had completely turned.</p>
<p id="line_697">‹Wait! It was the humans who were using my power! From now on, I will reduce the number of sacrifices. So—›</p>
<p id="line_698">“If only you had used that power for good, you could have alleviated some of the suffering. You may regret it in the afterlife.”</p>
<p id="line_699">‹Wait—›</p>
<p id="line_700">“—Inferno Flame—”</p>
<p id="line_701">Without further argument, Shizu unleashed her refined magic power on Jilzaridhara. In that moment, Jilzaridhara’s body Altered as if guided by flames, burning away to ashes. Thus, Jilzaridhara vanished from this world without a chance to resist.</p>
<p id="line_702">Fuze and Alfred witnessed the entire sequence of events. They then muttered their thoughts quietly.</p>
<p id="line_703">“That was insane. From now on, I’ve got to make sure never to anger Shizu-san.”</p>
<p id="line_704">“I agree.”</p>
<p id="line_705">“But man, we didn’t get our moment, did we?”</p>
<p id="line_706">“Yeah. I was ready to shield Shizu-dono with my own body if needed, but I never got the chance.”</p>
<p id="line_707">They looked at each other and sighed in unison. However, with Shizu’s victory, the battle came to an end. The crisis had passed. Remembering this, both of them began to show expressions of relief and joy.</p>
<p id="line_708">News of Shizu’s victory spread outside, and the cathedral was soon filled with cheers.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_709">When I defeated Jilzaridhara, the battle outside had also reached its conclusion.</p>
<p id="line_710">Fuze-kun ran up to me and handed me the mask, then filled me in on the situation outside. Alfred joined in the explanation, informing me that the operation had been successful.</p>
<p id="line_711">At the moment Prince Edward was killed, the morale of the Second Prince faction plummeted. Once Ash fell, members of the Echidna attempted to flee, but those who tried were either captured or killed by the knights waiting outside. It seemed none managed to escape.</p>
<p id="line_712">“Thank you, Shizu-dono! Truly, you are a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the savior of our kingdom,” expressed Prince Reinhardt, conveying his gratitude.</p>
<p id="line_713">With the king’s condition stable, it seemed that the Kingdom of Grada would soon return to its usual calm.</p>
<p id="line_714">My role in this kingdom had come to an end.</p>
<p id="line_715">………</p>
<p id="line_716">……</p>
<p id="line_717">…</p>
<p id="line_718">It was quite hectic for about a week, with ceremonies and welcoming feasts. Although I was told they were preparing a grand reward for me, I didn’t particularly want it. Instead, I requested a respectful memorial for the children who sacrificed themselves and for those who lost their lives in the turmoil. It might be just a small gesture, but I thought it was better than doing nothing at all.</p>
<p id="line_719">Now, I needed to change my mindset. I couldn’t stay in this country forever.</p>
<p id="line_720">Through this incident, I became interested in the organization Ash belonged to—Echidna. How did Echidna gather “otherworlders”? Ash had referred to the children as failures, implying there were others who had been summoned as well. Summoning from another world wasn’t easy. If they managed to summon multiple “otherworlders,” it was crucial to investigate how they did it.</p>
<p id="line_721">Moreover, it seemed Ash knew I had been summoned by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon.</p>
<p id="line_722">What that meant was…</p>
<p id="line_723">There was a possible connection between Ash, or rather the organization he belonged to, Echidna, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. To me, that was an issue that couldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p id="line_724"><em>What if, hypothetically, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is spreading misfortune?</em></p>
<p id="line_725">As someone whose life was saved by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, I felt a duty to correct any mistakes he might have made.</p>
<p id="line_726">“Then, Fuze-kun. I’m going to return to wandering, so please take care of things with Heinz-san.”</p>
<p id="line_727">“Got it. I’ll let him know. But you’ll visit Blumund again sometime, right?”</p>
<p id="line_728">“Of course!”</p>
<p id="line_729">“Then let me treat you to a meal when you do.”</p>
<p id="line_730">“Yeah, looking forward to it.”</p>
<p id="line_731">“Shizu-dono, when you visit our Kingdom of Grada, please come see me as well. Now that our guardian deity has gone, your connection with us will nurture the peace of mind of the people.”</p>
<p id="line_732">“I understand, Al-san. I’ll be sure to reach out when that time comes.”</p>
<p id="line_733">“Please! I’ll prepare delicious food to welcome you.”</p>
<p id="line_734">“Ahaha, I’ve already been treated to plenty this time, so you don’t need to go through so much trouble.”</p>
<p id="line_735">With a feeling of reluctance hidden within, I turned my back on them.</p>
<p id="line_736">“See you! Shizu-san, take care!”</p>
<p id="line_737">“I wish you the best of luck!”</p>
<p id="line_738">Without turning back to their voices, I raised one hand in acknowledgment. Then I started walking.</p>
<p id="line_739"><em>If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is involved in Echidna’s evil deeds…</em> It would be my duty to stop his wrongdoing with my own hands. Thus began my investigation into the vast organization of Echidna.</p>
<p id="line_740">This marked the beginning of my fateful connection with Echidna. Soon, I would find myself embroiled in a great battle.</p>
<p id="line_741">I wished to extend my hand to those I could save with it. I prayed that the grief and sadness pervading this world may diminish, even slightly. I aspired to become a beacon of hope for the weak and vulnerable. My journey would not end until my life did.</p>
<p id="line_742">«May we meet again someday, somewhere.»</p>

<p class="no-indent" id="line_744">In a dark forest, a woman knelt in a small clearing, lamenting. At the center of the clearing lay her companion, barely breathing.</p>
<p id="line_745">The rugged man with short-cropped hair had three large wounds on his back—fatal injuries that left him with little time to live. The woman knew this all too well. She understood that no matter what she tried, it was impossible to save him.</p>
<p id="line_746"><em>I won’t forgive them. Those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—I’ll never forgive them.</em></p>
<p id="line_747">Without hesitation, she resorted to forbidden magic.</p>
<p id="line_748">Using the blood flowing from the man, she drew a magic circle filled with her grudge and whispered a prayer. Without regard for the consequences, she poured her own life force into the magic.</p>
<p id="line_749">They had promised to marry once the mission was over, but that promise would never be fulfilled. So, at the very least…</p>
<p id="line_750"><em>I want us to be together at the time of our death</em>, she thought.</p>
<p id="line_751">She sought vengeance against those who had deceived and used them. She had no intention of being killed by the pursuers who would soon arrive. That was why she risked everything on this final gamble.</p>
<p id="line_752">The forbidden magic was a summoning spell, not uncommon by any means. But what it summoned weren’t angels or spirits—they were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_753">Evil begets evil.</p>
<p id="line_754">Resigned to her impending death, the woman had no kindness left to choose a gentler path. Moreover, this was the most reliable method, with the highest success rate.</p>
<p id="line_755">Unlike angels or spirits, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> always lent their power in exchange for a promise. Summoning a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> beyond one’s abilities could lead to their disaster, but for a woman facing the end of her life, such concerns were irrelevant.</p>
<p id="line_756">Normally composed, she resorted to a forbidden method she would never have considered, ignoring all limits and constraints, to complete the summoning magic.</p>
<p id="line_757">The summoned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared almost human, dressed in luxurious attire. Golden eyes with a crimson gleam. White skin. Beautiful black hair streaked with red and gold.</p>
<p id="line_758">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Are you the fool who summoned me without knowing her place?”</p>
<p id="line_759">Though spoken in a gentle tone, the question carried an undertone that would send shivers down anyone’s spine. Normally, one would fear that voice, but the woman remained unmoved. Her mind was clouded, filled only with a powerful resentment.</p>
<p id="line_760">“If God won’t heed my prayers, then even a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will do. I offer my soul. Take whatever you desire. Just please, I beg you—that guy, that guy—”</p>
<p id="line_761">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> observed her coldly.</p>
<p id="line_762">Then, with a slight nod, he declared, “Very well. For my amusement, I shall grant your wish.”</p>
<p id="line_763">For the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it was merely a whim. He showed only fleeting interest in the woman’s intense resentment. However, for the woman, it was the answer she sought.</p>
<p id="line_764">“Oh, thank you. As for the reward…”</p>
<p id="line_765">With those words, she collapsed. Exhausted to the core, her life came to an end.</p>
<p id="line_766">At that same moment, the heartbeat of the man lying beside her also ceased. Just as she had wished, their final moments were synchronized without the slightest delay.</p>
<p id="line_767">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood alone, looking down at the woman’s satisfied expression as her breath faded away.</p>
<p id="line_768">“Hmm, the contract is complete. Your emotions were quite delicious. Consider this a grand service.”</p>
<p id="line_769">As the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sneered wickedly, he noticed the sound of approaching footsteps around the clearing.</p>
<p id="line_770">“However…with a reward of this magnitude, it should last for about three days. For anything lacking…”</p>
<p id="line_771"><em>—I can make up for it with the prey the woman has prepared,</em> the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought to himself, chuckling quietly.</p>
<p id="line_772">In the dark forest, silence fell.</p>
<p id="line_773">In the next moment, the attackers would realize too late the unimaginable malice born from the final desperate resistance of their quarry.</p>
<p id="line_774">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it’s been a while since I’ve been in this realm. I shall enjoy myself to the fullest.”</p>
<p id="line_775">With a sinister smirk, the malice began to move.</p>
<p id="line_776">In that place, only the bloodstains of those who had died in despair remained…</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_777">The Kingdom of Filtwood, a small nation with a population of less than three hundred thousand, lay near the Great Forest of Jura.</p>
<p id="line_778">Shizue Izawa, known as Shizu, was visiting this country at the request of the Kingdom of Blumund, where she had been staying. The urgent plea from Filtwood had been sent to surrounding nations: “Subjugate the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.” The task was deemed too difficult for ordinary adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_779"><em>It’s a state request, but something feels off. Even Heinz-san seemed hesitant—maybe I should have turned it down?</em></p>
<p id="line_780">The proposal had come from Heinz, a manager at the Adventurers’ Guild. But even he seemed doubtful about the situation.</p>
<p id="line_781">‹Off the record, it’s rumored that several skilled individuals have already gone missing. And yet, the cause remains unclear. They claim it’s to defeat a resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but I’m not convinced.› Heinz confided to Shizu.</p>
<p id="line_782">Naturally, the Kingdom of Blumund had been conducting its own investigation. However, delving into the internal affairs of Filtwood was not an easy task.</p>
<p id="line_783">The best they could do was gather rumors. In such circumstances, they sent out the request to the adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_784">Adventurers often form mutual support systems that transcend national frameworks. Refusing to cooperate could potentially strain relations between nations in the future. For Blumund, the calculation seemed clear—they had to show a cooperative attitude, even if reluctantly.</p>
<p id="line_785">For Shizu, this was troublesome, but refusal was not an option. The moment Heinz approached her, it was apparent that no one else was capable of handling this task. The request was so perilous that it couldn’t be handled without the help of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Understanding this, Shizu had come to Filtwood.</p>
<p id="line_786">When Shizu arrived at the royal castle, she was greeted by a senior knight.</p>
<p id="line_787">“Ah, if it isn’t Shizue Izawa-sama! It’s an honor to meet the renowned Conqueror of Flames!”</p>
<p id="line_788">Due to her signature mask, Shizu was often recognized without needing to introduce herself, and this time was no different.</p>
<p id="line_789">The “Anti-Magic Mask” she wore was a genuine magical item. It adhered to her face without straps, as if suctioned on, making it easily distinguishable from fakes. Simply possessing it served as a form of identification.</p>
<p id="line_790">With a brief greeting, Shizu acknowledged the knight, though she couldn’t help but think, <em>Here we go again</em>, as she followed her guide.</p>
<p id="line_791">“A banquet will be held in the hall tonight, so please relax here until then,” the knight said, assigning her to a private room.</p>
<p id="line_792">Such exceptional treatment was only natural. In the adventurers’ hierarchy, there were novices, skilled individuals, masters, and above them all, those with “epithets.” Shizu was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> known as the Conqueror of Flames, as the senior knight had addressed her. In the Adventurers’ Guild, there was no one who didn’t know her name.</p>
<p id="line_793">“Thank you,” Shizu said, accepting the senior knight’s suggestion without protest.</p>
<p id="line_794">In front of other adventurers, treating a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> poorly would have been unthinkable. Shizu felt that refusing the offer would actually be more disrespectful.</p>
<p id="line_795">And then, night fell.</p>
<p id="line_796">A different knight from before came to call Shizu. When she was guided into the great hall, she saw that a large number of adventurers had already gathered. Even within the castle, many were still armed. Since the king’s quarters were separate, adventurers were permitted to carry their weapons.</p>
<p id="line_797">The tables were laden with dishes for everyone to help themselves, but the adventurers seemed more interested in exchanging information than in the food.</p>
<p id="line_798">Shizu, with her distinctive mask, stood out immediately.</p>
<p id="line_799">Her presence, as a high-ranking adventurer, brought a sense of relief to the gathered crowd. It was only natural—they knew their chances of survival increased when undertaking a quest with someone of her skill.</p>
<p id="line_800">The room buzzed with excitement at the sight of the famous person, but Shizu remained completely unfazed. She calmly let the gazes wash over her, taking in the state of the venue.</p>
<p id="line_801">Many renowned figures were present, some of whom were familiar to Shizu. It seemed only those with proven abilities were being approached or spoken to. Adventurers were not volunteers; summoning them required payment. Given that this was a state request, it was impossible to simply ignore their duty.</p>
<p id="line_802">The assembly of such a group indicated that the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> they were targeting was likely a formidable foe, possibly on the level of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The difficulty was feared to be equivalent to a threat of national upheaval. They seemed to be preparing for a Calamity-class scenario, akin to battling a dragon.</p>
<p id="line_803">As evidence, the security in the grand hall was tight. Several knights were stationed in front of various doors. It seemed others were positioned in separate rooms, and royal castle-employed mages appeared to be on high alert.</p>
<p id="line_804">“Currently, tensions are high within the castle in preparation for the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In fact, last night— Oh, my apologies. It seems the minister will soon address this during dinner. Please pardon my earlier remarks.”</p>
<p id="line_805"><em>Having said so much, you might as well finish the thought,</em> Shizu mused but reconsidered, mindful of the knight’s position.</p>
<p id="line_806">When Shizu nodded slightly, the knight guiding her bowed and left.</p>
<p id="line_807">Left alone, Shizu was soon approached in a friendly manner.</p>
<p id="line_808">“Hey there, Shizu-san! You’re here for this quest too?”</p>
<p id="line_809">The one addressing her was a warrior clad in a striking suit of magic armor—Cougar, someone Shizu had worked with several times before.</p>
<p id="line_810">Cougar prided himself on his toughness, and his magic armor’s ability to provide a “continuous, albeit small, healing effect” made him a reliable frontline warrior.</p>
<p id="line_811">As someone trustworthy, Shizu responded without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_812">“Long time no see, Cougar-san. Heinz-san was hesitant, but it’s a commission from the kingdom.”</p>
<p id="line_813">“Kuhh, still as serious as ever,” Cougar said and suggested, “You could always come up with some casual excuse and bail out,” which made Shizu chuckle wryly.</p>
<p id="line_814">“You say that, and yet you’re here.”</p>
<p id="line_815">“Well, yeah. I’m here for the reward, you know. But now I’m starting to regret it.”</p>
<p id="line_816">Cougar laughed, but his eyes didn’t. For a brief moment, he glanced at the knights guarding the door before turning back to Shizu.</p>
<p id="line_817">That brief glance was enough for Shizu to understand Cougar’s intentions.</p>
<p id="line_818"><em>Indeed. The knights guarding the door—essentially, this kingdom—are not allies, are they? Despite being the client, they can’t be trusted.</em></p>
<p id="line_819">Being deceived by a client was commonplace in this world.</p>
<p id="line_820">No matter how powerful someone might be, letting their guard down could make them vulnerable. Falling into a trap due to harbored resentment was a risk anyone could face.</p>
<p id="line_821">Even with national commissions, such scenarios were not unheard of. Many rulers prioritized their own knights, viewing adventurers as expendable pawns.</p>
<p id="line_822">Shizu had been well-briefed on such matters by Heinz and others, so she could roughly deduce the situation from Cougar’s demeanor.</p>
<p id="line_823">“—Is it true that several skilled individuals have gone missing?”</p>
<p id="line_824">“…! As expected, you knew about it.”</p>
<p id="line_825">Shizu asked in a hushed voice, and Cougar replied in kind.</p>
<p id="line_826">Out of sight of the knights, Cougar began explaining the situation to Shizu, maintaining the appearance of casual conversation but speaking in a volume only she could hear.</p>
<p id="line_827">According to Cougar, the first adventurers had arrived in this country about a month ago. Since then, more adventurers had gradually gathered, but several of them had been brutally murdered during the night. These weren’t novices; they had posted lookouts, yet the killings continued.</p>
<p id="line_828">These incidents occurred at a rate of once a week. The number of victims had already surpassed ten. Moreover, since last night, a team of adventurers known by their epithet, the Silver Wings, had gone missing.</p>
<p id="line_829">With prominent figures falling victim, anxiety among the adventurers was inevitable. Cougar concluded that a full-scale extermination operation needed to be initiated soon. Otherwise, the dissatisfaction and fear among the adventurers would reach their breaking point.</p>
<p id="line_830">“I see. So that’s why everyone seemed relieved when they saw me.”</p>
<p id="line_831">“Yeah. With a new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appearing in this situation, even I started feeling hopeful about surviving.”</p>
<p id="line_832">“You’re exaggerating.”</p>
<p id="line_833">“Not at all. Now, if only the Silver folks are safe—”</p>
<p id="line_834">But Cougar’s hope was soon shattered by the words of the arriving minister.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_835">“Adventurers! I bring unfortunate news. Both of our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, the Silver Wings, have perished. Their bodies were completely consumed, leaving only traces of blood at the scene.”</p>
<p id="line_836">The minister, flanked by knights, ascended the platform and delivered this grim news as soon as he began speaking.</p>
<p id="line_837">The great hall fell silent as everyone focused intently on the minister’s words, struggling to believe what they were hearing.</p>
<p id="line_838">“As you all know, the current mission is the ‘extermination of the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ It also seems to have been revived a hundred years ago, with warnings recorded in our archives. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is described as cunning and dangerous, and our country has been on guard for some time. Since it’s not guaranteed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s will appear this time as they did before, we invited the two <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s—the Silver Wings—as esteemed guests of the state. Unfortunately, this is the situation we now face.”</p>
<p id="line_839">The minister spoke with a sorrowful expression.</p>
<p id="line_840">It seemed that even nobles from the Kingdom of Filtwood had fallen victim. The minister emphasized that there was no time to waste and that immediate measures were necessary.</p>
<p id="line_841">“Last night, many of our knights also fell victim. Despite our efforts, the vile <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> eluded us. But tonight will be different! I implore all of you to lend us your strength.”</p>
<p id="line_842">As soon as the minister finished speaking, the room erupted into chaos.</p>
<p id="line_843">So far, the investigations had yielded no results, and the enemy’s strength remained unknown. The only confirmed detail was that they were dealing with a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with little else revealed.</p>
<p id="line_844">The archives had been thoroughly examined, but the records simply stated, ‘The national knight Orthos successfully sealed the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ From these records, two things could be inferred: the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had seemingly manifested in physical form, and it was predicted to potentially resurrect approximately a hundred years later.</p>
<p id="line_845">Orthos, originally just a soldier, became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after repelling the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and was appointed as a prestigious national knight. He had no family and reportedly went to his grave without ever speaking of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> again.</p>
<p id="line_846">In other words, there was no substantial information available.</p>
<p id="line_847">Given the circumstances and the minister’s statement, it was only natural that the room erupted into chaos.</p>
<p id="line_848">“Hey, are you for real? That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> killed those famous lovebirds—Silver!”</p>
<p id="line_849">A high-ranking adventurer who seemed to have just arrived shouted at the minister with an accusatory tone.</p>
<p id="line_850">“Y-you’ve got to be kidding. Those are <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s with the epithet Silver! If even those incredible individuals failed at this mission, we’d be signing our own death warrants!”</p>
<p id="line_851">“And on top of that, we have no information about the enemy at all. At this rate, it’s like you’re telling us to go die!”</p>
<p id="line_852">Shouts of agreement erupted from various corners of the room.</p>
<p id="line_853">The adventurers’ complaints were entirely reasonable, and Shizu felt the same way.</p>
<p id="line_854">Although she didn’t personally know the two members of the Silver Wings, their combination of warrior and mage was reputed to be exceptional. Even Shizu would struggle against both of them simultaneously.</p>
<p id="line_855">Challenging such a formidable enemy without a strategy, especially one that had defeated high-ranking adventurers, was sheer folly. The adventurers’ arguments were entirely justified.</p>
<p id="line_856"><em>—But why would a high-ranking official make such a tactless statement? This would only result in losing the adventurers’ cooperation…</em></p>
<p id="line_857">Shizu’s concerns were echoed by the actions of a single adventurer.</p>
<p id="line_858">“I-I’m out. I’d be knocking on death’s door by taking on such a request!”</p>
<p id="line_859">With those words, a man made an attempt to flee.</p>
<p id="line_860">Most present naturally thought his reaction was understandable. However, the next moment, an unforeseen event occurred that none of them could have imagined.</p>
<p id="line_861">“Please wait. I understand your frustrations very well.

<p id="line_862">As the minister spoke, the knights guarding the door drew their swords and took up defensive positions.</p>
<p id="line_863">“Hey, hey, looks like they’re not planning to let us go…”</p>
<p id="line_864">Next to Shizu, Cougar muttered quietly.</p>
<p id="line_865">Someone else complained, “Are you planning to use us as bait or something?”—a sentiment that seemed to reflect the current situation accurately.</p>
<p id="line_866">“Everyone, please calm down! It is true that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has been resurrected, but its whereabouts are unknown. This is regrettable for all of us.

<p id="line_867">The tumultuous hall quieted naturally as the minister began speaking.</p>
<p id="line_868">If they attempted to escape, they would end up making enemies of the state. To avoid that, the adventurers had no choice but to go along with the minister’s plan. At the very least, they decided to hear out the discussion first.</p>
<p id="line_869">“To tell you the truth, we have determined what the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is targeting.”</p>
<p id="line_870">The adventurers buzzed with excitement at this revelation, but the minister continued unperturbed.</p>
<p id="line_871">He explained that there was a sealed room in the castle’s underground where a single body lay. The minister clarified that this body was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s physical form, and its goal was to retrieve it to achieve complete resurrection.</p>
<p id="line_872">Shizu raised her hand, signaling a question and requesting permission to speak.</p>
<p id="line_873">“Oh, you’re the renowned Shizue Izawa, aren’t you? I will answer any questions you have!”</p>
<p id="line_874">It seemed that Shizu’s reputation had reached the minister as well, and he readily granted her permission to speak.</p>
<p id="line_875">“If this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has brought the nation to the brink of destruction, it would seem to rival even an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in its threat. So, my question is—”</p>
<p id="line_876">If the danger level was truly Calamity-class, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in question would be a terrifying entity worthy of legend.

<p id="line_877">Confident in her assumptions, Shizu asked her crucial question.</p>
<p id="line_878">“—Does this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have a name?”</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_879">The grand hall fell dead silent.</p>
<p id="line_880"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gain significantly more power upon receiving a name. This was common knowledge among adventurers of a certain level or higher. Therefore, Shizu’s question held profound significance.</p>
<p id="line_881">There were instances where a named <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could be stronger than an unnamed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Typically, when a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> acquired a name, it evolved; a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with a name would almost certainly evolve into an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_882">The enemy this time was not a newcomer but a seasoned being who had existed for at least a hundred years, accumulating knowledge, experience, and mastery of cunning. Even if it were merely a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it was imperative to recognize it as a threat on par with an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If such an opponent had a name, their threat level would be considerably higher.</p>
<p id="line_883">While only a few adventurers possessed this level of understanding, Shizu had been meticulously educated by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. Thus, she was acutely aware of how troublesome <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that had incarnated and gained intelligence could be.</p>
<p id="line_884">“…A name? No, there is no mention of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> having a name.”</p>
<p id="line_885">Upon hearing that, Shizu felt a small sense of relief.</p>
<p id="line_886"><em>If the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> doesn’t have a name, it might not be at the level of an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It’s likely just a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that has incarnated and increased its power.</em></p>
<p id="line_887">If that’s the case, it might not be Calamity-class as feared; it could be of Hazard-class instead.</p>
<p id="line_888"><em>No, that’s premature thinking. If it’s Hazard-class, I don’t think the Silver would lose…</em></p>
<p id="line_889">There was a chance they were caught off guard, but Shizu deemed it too risky to make that assumption. For now, she took solace in the fact that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t have a name.</p>
<p id="line_890">“That’s a relief. So, Minister, do you intend to keep us here and wait for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to come?”</p>
<p id="line_891">“Indeed. It was a difficult decision for our country, but now that the Silver Wings have been defeated, we have no choice but to stake our hopes on this plan. Please, understand our position!”</p>
<p id="line_892">The minister’s plan was understandable. If adventurers scattered throughout the town, the forces would be divided. There was a risk of individuals being targeted and killed, much like the Silver Wings. Keeping everyone confined within the castle seemed a prudent decision.</p>
<p id="line_893">Yet, Shizu couldn’t shake off her unease about the minister’s words.</p>
<p id="line_894">If that was the plan, it should have been communicated clearly from the start. The minister’s lack of transparency raised concerns.</p>
<p id="line_895">Even now, knights were blocking the doors, creating a situation where the adventurers had no choice but to comply with the minister’s directives.</p>
<p id="line_896"><em>I don’t feel good about this. It seems like they see us as potential enemies instead of allies—wait, could it be?</em></p>
<p id="line_897">Shizu wondered if the minister was hiding something. His words seemed truthful, but there was a possibility he had other objectives.</p>
<p id="line_898">That suspicion turned out to be correct.</p>
<p id="line_899">“Don’t joke around! We don’t have any obligation to obey this country. Let us—”</p>
<p id="line_900">The man who first tried to escape shouted again. Ignoring the knights standing at the door, he attempted to leave the grand hall. But in the next moment, the knight captain acted swiftly.</p>
<p id="line_901">The adventurer was cut down with a drawn sword.</p>
<p id="line_902">“…!”</p>
<p id="line_903">“You struck him down! What do you think you’re doing?!”</p>
<p id="line_904">The adventurers were thrown into chaos, but the knight captain remained calm and composed.</p>
<p id="line_905">“Silence! Before you speak out, take a good look at this man!”</p>
<p id="line_906">With those words, the knight captain kicked the fallen adventurer.</p>
<p id="line_907">The man lay sprawled on the floor, clutching his wound in pain in front of the adventurers. From him, a sinister shadow began to separate.</p>
<p id="line_908">“A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="lesser demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…”</p>
<p id="line_909">Someone’s murmur echoed through the hall.</p>
<p id="line_910">Before the shocked adventurers could fully grasp the situation, a spell from another knight caused the sinister shadow—a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="lesser demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—to vanish.</p>
<p id="line_911">“Did you see that? The reason we isolated you here is that there might be others possessed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like this one. We observed suspicious behavior in this individual, but there could be more <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hiding among us. It seems the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can summon these low-grade <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which pose a threat in numbers.

<p id="line_912">The knight captain’s one-sided statement stirred a commotion in the room.</p>
<p id="line_913">Internally, Shizu sighed, realizing that the situation had become even more complicated.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_914">The room teetered on the edge of panic.</p>
<p id="line_915">The only reason violence hadn’t erupted was the presence of several skilled individuals. Still, the lower-ranked members, lured by the promise of high rewards, remained tense, casting wary glances around the room.</p>
<p id="line_916">“This is bad. Those who don’t know who’s on their side are starting to panic.”</p>
<p id="line_917">“You’re right. Even knowing who’s who doesn’t necessarily bring peace of mind.”</p>
<p id="line_918">Though not mentioned by the knight captain, there was also the looming threat of being overwhelmed by numbers and having one’s body taken over. Unless exceptionally strong, one couldn’t completely dismiss the possibility of being possessed by a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_919">In a situation like this, the only person you could trust was yourself.</p>
<p id="line_920">The situation had reached a critical point, deepening Shizu’s suspicions even further.</p>
<p id="line_921"><em>They should have anticipated this from the beginning. So why create such confusion…? It was almost as if the goal was to sow paranoia.</em> As she reached this realization, Shizu became fearful of her own thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_922">There were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> among the gathered adventurers. Revealing that fact caused paranoia to spread among them. What would happen next was likely a round of probing, followed by a witch hunt. Suspicious individuals might be killed before they even had a chance to explain themselves.</p>
<p id="line_923">Cougar realized this too, and so did the other experienced, high-ranking adventurers. They understood the situation was dangerous. However, any rash actions could make them the first to be suspected. A careless remark could easily draw hostility from the adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_924">“This is bad…”</p>
<p id="line_925">“Yeah, in this situation, we can’t afford to make any careless moves.”</p>
<p id="line_926">Cougar and Shizu exchanged quick glances, silently confirming each other’s intentions. Without words, they both pondered the best course of action.</p>
<p id="line_927">At that moment, an adventurer began to laugh.</p>
<p id="line_928">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This is interesting. Among those gathered here, there are <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. By planting that seed of doubt, you’ve ensured they won’t form an instant bond of cooperation, correct? No matter how strong they are individually, without unity, they’re vulnerable. So even well-disciplined knights can manage them with ease. Isn’t that what you’re suggesting?”</p>
<p id="line_929">This adventurer had blended in seamlessly with the others, appearing as just another participant.</p>
<p id="line_930">He had striking black hair, uncommon in this world, and was quite handsome. His robe, resembling a mage’s attire, was luxurious, hinting that he wasn’t in desperate need of money.</p>
<p id="line_931">His participation was likely motivated by a desire for self-promotion, fueled by confidence in his own abilities. As evidence:</p>
<p id="line_932">“Who’s that guy?”</p>
<p id="line_933">“Dunno. Never seen him before.”</p>
<p id="line_934">These whispers spread among the adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_935">“Shizu-san, that guy isn’t just some ordinary person…”</p>
<p id="line_936">“Yeah. He looks like a mage, but there’s no opening in his defenses. It’s hard to believe someone that skilled is unknown.”</p>
<p id="line_937">Shizu’s observation made Cougar nod in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_938">The man had no noticeable presence until he began to speak, and no one had paid any attention to him before. What was his true purpose? Cougar and Shizu decided to watch quietly, remaining cautious, as events unfolded.</p>
<p id="line_939">“What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p id="line_940">The minister fixed a sharp gaze on the man, questioning him sternly.</p>
<p id="line_941">In response, the man chuckled calmly, “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Oh, no, you see, it just seemed like this task could be accomplished more easily than I thought, so I couldn’t help but laugh.”</p>
<p id="line_942">“What?”</p>
<p id="line_943">“Earlier, you over there said, ‘If you do anything strange, you’ll be treated as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and cut down accordingly,’ right? So, what are you going to do? I don’t intend to follow you, nor do I plan to play along with your little charade.”</p>
<p id="line_944">“…Little charade?”</p>
<p id="line_945">The knight captain’s face reddened with anger at the man’s words. He held back his fury with reason, but it was clear his restraint wouldn’t last long.</p>
<p id="line_946">Before anyone realized it, a wide space had formed around the man as everyone kept their distance, not wanting to be drawn into the confrontation. The knights then moved in, surrounding the man to corner him.</p>
<p id="line_947">“Are you going to play innocent? You were the one who summoned the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="lesser demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, weren’t you? When a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is summoned, there’s a mana connection between the summoner and the summoned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This is common knowledge, isn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_948">The man’s gaze was fixed on a mage who stood guarded by knights. The mage’s visibly shaken reaction confirmed to Shizu that the man’s accusation was true. However…</p>
<p id="line_949"><em>I can’t believe it. I know about the mana connection, but that’s not widely known. Besides, how did he ‘see’ that connection?</em></p>
<p id="line_950">Humans couldn’t visually perceive the flow of mana with their natural abilities. Only those highly skilled in manipulating mana might barely sense it through intuition. Yet, the man spoke of it as if it were nothing. This alone revealed his abnormality.</p>
<p id="line_951">“Wha—You—?!”</p>
<p id="line_952">“Are you mocking us with this nonsense?!”</p>
<p id="line_953">The knights drew their swords, but the man remained calm and composed.</p>
<p id="line_954">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. You tried to cut that man down without even verifying who he was, just because he attempted to leave this grand hall. Just because he turned out to be a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> doesn’t make your actions justifiable. Perhaps you intended to brush it off naturally, but I must say, it’s quite sloppy.”</p>
<p id="line_955">His tone might have seemed mocking, but his argument was sound. Shizu agreed with his reasoning, but she couldn’t fully side with him. There was a sinister aura about him that unsettled her deeply. And Shizu’s unease soon proved justified.</p>
<p id="line_956">“Are you defying the state’s policy?” the seething knight captain demanded.</p>
<p id="line_957">The man replied calmly, “No.”</p>
<p id="line_958">“I wholeheartedly agree with the policy, as it saves me a lot of trouble. Regarding my order to ‘subjugate the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ there’s no restriction stating I must ‘only kill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ It seems this country’s policy aligns with that as well, so I see no reason why I should be solely criticized.”</p>
<p id="line_959">The arrogant man began to say something even more outrageous. Everyone present understood the implications of his words.</p>
<p id="line_960">The resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was believed to be seeking its sealed body, possibly disguising itself as a human to do so. According to the country’s policy, killing those deemed suspicious was justified if it helped uncover the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_961">In other words—</p>
<p id="line_962">“Are you planning to massacre everyone here to find the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_963">Shizu’s question cut to the heart of the matter. The man had no intention of being selective in his methods.</p>
<p id="line_964">“Correct.”</p>
<p id="line_965">With a beautiful smile, the man affirmed Shizu’s suspicion.</p>
<p id="line_966">The knights quickly moved to protect the minister, while the adventurers divided—some fled, while others prepared to confront the man. Shizu stepped forward, ready to face him directly. She couldn’t allow his rampage to continue unchecked. Cougar followed her lead. He was the kind of man who wouldn’t back down in a situation like this.</p>
<p id="line_967">With the appearance of such renowned and skilled individuals, the atmosphere in the room shifted dramatically. Some were frightened, but others rallied, ready to support Shizu and Cougar.</p>
<p id="line_968">Among those gathered, there could indeed be a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The adventurers believed that by watching each other, they could prevent a surprise attack from any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_969">In this tense situation, even the knights couldn’t act recklessly. Interfering without cause might provoke the adventurers’ wrath. Individually, they might not pose a great threat, but as a group, adventurers were a fearsome force.</p>
<p id="line_970">Seeing the assembly before him, the man smirked smugly.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_971">The man’s true identity was that of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, summoned by one of the Silver Wings just before her death.</p>
<p id="line_972">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> chose the most straightforward means to fulfill the request. He operated without ethical considerations, adhering strictly to the contract and taking the most efficient actions.</p>
<p id="line_973">“Who are you?” Shizu demanded.</p>
<p id="line_974">“Yes, well, it’s a name from an old acquaintance, but you can call me ‘Kuro,”’ the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Kuro—responded.</p>
<p id="line_975"><em>Kuro…? I don’t recall hearing that name before, but it feels familiar somehow…</em></p>
<p id="line_976">Shizu felt as though she was on the verge of recalling something, but she knew now wasn’t the time to dwell on it.</p>
<p id="line_977">“I am Shizu. I cannot condone your actions. While it’s true that ‘there’s a magical connection between the summoned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the summoner,’ it cannot be proven.”</p>
<p id="line_978">With that declaration, Shizu confronted Kuro directly.</p>
<p id="line_979">Since there was no proof, Shizu couldn’t definitively conclude, as Kuro suggested, that the knights’ actions were staged. If they were prepared to brandish swords based on mere suspicion, Shizu had no intention of following the country’s orders. But more importantly, she wasn’t about to let Kuro have his way either.</p>
<p id="line_980">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, how amusing. Then, I shall dispose of you first!”</p>
<p id="line_981">With that, Kuro unleashed magic without any incantation. For Kuro, an ancient <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, using magic was as natural as breathing. A scorching mass of raging fire—Fireball—hurtled toward Shizu, but the moment it touched her, it fizzled out.</p>
<p id="line_982">“—Hm?”</p>
<p id="line_983">“Fire doesn’t affect me.”</p>
<p id="line_984">“…I see. A high-ranking spirit, and a perfect Fusion at that. With this body, you’re a bit of a nuisance. However, nothing I can’t handle.”</p>
<p id="line_985">Shizu and Kuro locked eyes, and in an instant, their intense battle began.</p>
<p id="line_986">Shizu’s sword, enveloped in flames, took on the properties of a magic sword. Spirits held a natural advantage over <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so if Kuro were to be slashed by it, he would suffer significant, perhaps even irreparable, damage.</p>
<p id="line_987">At that moment, Kuro materialized sharp, formidable claws on both of his hands. These were his favored weapons, known as Scissor Claws. Although Kuro could easily secure victory using magic, he chose instead to engage in close combat with his weapon.</p>
<p id="line_988">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I shall indulge you for a little while.”</p>
<p id="line_989">“Don’t underestimate me!”</p>
<p id="line_990">As the battle’s intensity grew, the onlookers could only watch in stunned silence.</p>
<p id="line_991">“A-amazing…”</p>
<p id="line_992">“S-so this is the pinnacle…the strength of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> reigning at the top of adventurers…”</p>
<p id="line_993">“Incredible. I guess the title Conqueror of Flames isn’t just for show—”</p>
<p id="line_994">Praises for Shizu echoed around her. With her flashy, fire-based attacks, it appeared to the onlookers that Shizu had the upper hand.</p>
<p id="line_995">“Shizu-san…”</p>
<p id="line_996">However, the reality was different from what it seemed. Some, like Cougar, realized this. Despite what appeared to be a physical disadvantage, it was Kuro who held the upper hand. Kuro’s vast combat experience was so extensive that even with all of Shizu’s abilities, she couldn’t fully grasp his depth.</p>
<p id="line_997">“…Who are you, really?”</p>
<p id="line_998">Kuro chuckled, “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kufufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Should someone about to die concern themselves with that? Even if you knew, it would only lead to despair,” and sneered, “That is, if you knew.”</p>
<p id="line_999">“I see. It seems you’re not the type to instigate this kind of event. You’re more—”</p>
<p id="line_1000">“Even so, it’s a matter that doesn’t concern you, does it?”</p>
<p id="line_1001"><em>True, it doesn’t concern me,</em> Shizu thought. Yet, she realized that the man calling himself Kuro was too dangerous to be left unchecked. Determined, Shizu resolved to unleash her most powerful magic.</p>
<p id="line_1002">“You’re too dangerous. Sorry, but I have to get serious now.”</p>
<p id="line_1003">“Kufufufufu, how interesting.”</p>
<p id="line_1004">Kuro remained calm and unmoved, ready to take Shizu’s attack head-on.</p>
<p id="line_1005"><em>That composure will be your downfall.</em></p>
<p id="line_1006">“I’ll end this now! Inferno Flame—!”</p>
<p id="line_1007">Utilizing the full power of Ifrit and channeling all her willpower and mana, Shizu unleashed her ultimate technique. This fiery assault, the pinnacle of spirit magic, surpassed even the heat intensity of nuclear magic, Nuclear Cannon, and struck Kuro directly.</p>
<p id="line_1008">When Shizu’s magic dissipated, Kuro stood there, transformed into an entirely different form. He now appeared almost human-like, yet his presence was unmistakably inhuman. Golden eyes gleamed with a crimson gleam. His skin was white as snow. The lavish robe had vanished in the flames, replaced by jet-black wings that enveloped and protected his body. He bore a striking resemblance to a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1009">“Kufufu, for a mere human to wield the power of Ifrit so masterfully… It feels like I’m truly ‘fighting’ again after a long time.”</p>
<p id="line_1010">“A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…? And you’re unscathed after withstanding the pinnacle of spirit magic?”</p>
<p id="line_1011">“An astute observation. However, let me correct you. I’m not unscathed; I did feel some pain,” Kuro said then laughed, “This is why battles are so interesting.”</p>
<p id="line_1012">What was despair for Shizu was akin to a death sentence for everyone present.</p>
<p id="line_1013">“Well then, let’s wrap this up, shall we?”</p>
<p id="line_1014">With that, Kuro unleashed a devastating blow. He swung his Scissor Claws with the intention of smashing Shizu’s head, unapologetically.</p>
<p id="line_1015">However…</p>
<p id="line_1016">The attack was blocked, leaving not a single scratch on Shizu’s mask. Not only that, but the arm that delivered the blow was blown away. For the first time, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> known as Kuro was shaken.</p>
<p id="line_1017">“Impossible! To deflect my attack, no, that ‘mask’… Could it be…that its temporal thickness…is infinite?!”</p>
<p id="line_1018">For the first time in thousands of years, Kuro was truly astonished, shaken to his core. In the face of this unbelievable situation, Kuro’s interest in Shizu deepened.</p>
<p id="line_1019"><em>My attacks are ineffective. That ‘mask’ must be bound by some kind of causality. And that temporal thickness… Considering it has existed longer than I have, that ‘mask’ seems to transcend time. Who possesses such an artifact? Kufufufufu, this is very intriguing indeed!</em></p>
<p id="line_1020">“Kufufufufu. That was more damage than I expected. Let’s call it quits for now!”</p>
<p id="line_1021">With that, Kuro halted his assault on Shizu. Showing no interest in the nominal outcome, he declared his own defeat and fled from the scene. The adventurers erupted in cheers.</p>
<p id="line_1022">“As expected of the Conqueror of Flames!”</p>
<p id="line_1023">“That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was all bark and no bite!”</p>
<p id="line_1024">Perhaps relieved at being saved, the praise for Shizu was loud and enthusiastic. Similarly, the knights, having witnessed Shizu’s strength, seemed to realize that their earlier attitudes had been quite unpalatable. Seizing the opportunity that their deception had not been exposed, they schemed to sweep everything under the rug.</p>
<p id="line_1025">“W-We have no intention whatsoever of making light of the adventurers. If we can just ascertain the identity of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, that would be enough!”</p>
<p id="line_1026">With the minister’s intervention and statement, the confusion in the room was temporarily brought under control.</p>
<p id="line_1027">And as for Shizu…</p>
<p id="line_1028">She was plagued by fatigue greater than she had anticipated. It was fortunate that Kuro withdrew. Continuing the fight would have been difficult, and Shizu knew she had no chance of winning.</p>
<p id="line_1029"><em>Thank goodness he withdrew. But what was that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s objective?</em></p>
<p id="line_1030">Kuro had mentioned the word “order.” It was hard for Shizu to believe that someone could command such a powerful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1031"><em>And that strength… He faced me while still holding back. He’s definitely beyond Calamity-class in terms of danger.</em></p>
<p id="line_1032">At that moment, Shizu suddenly remembered. She recalled how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon had warned her about the existence of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> known as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, among the threats he had mentioned. These nameless <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> schemed to manifest in this world, identified not by names but by distinctive colors.</p>
<p id="line_1033"><em>Could Kuro possibly be Noir…? No way, right?</em></p>
<p id="line_1034">Shizu dispelled that suspicion. After all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon had said, “That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is particularly heretical among the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s and very troublesome.” There was no way such a figure would be here. Moreover, the idea of them being bound by someone’s order was impossible, so Shizu quickly dismissed that thought.</p>
<p id="line_1035">Yet, deep in her heart, an unshakeable doubt remained.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1036">That night. A knight visited Shizu’s room.</p>
<p id="line_1037">“I apologize for the late hour. The king wishes to speak with you. I regret disturbing you when you are tired, but could you please follow me?”</p>
<p id="line_1038">Though Shizu was fatigued and wanted to rest, she knew she couldn’t ignore a request from the king.</p>
<p id="line_1039">“I understand. I will get ready.”</p>
<p id="line_1040">She tidied herself and decided to follow the knight. Notably, Shizu was the only one given a private room. Everyone else invited by the state was directed to large communal rooms, while the remaining guests were packed into any available lodging spaces. Given these circumstances, Shizu speculated that she was the only one summoned by the king.</p>
<p id="line_1041"><em>They’ll probably inquire about that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kuro. Considering they’re discussing countermeasures late into the night, even the country’s leadership has a tough time,</em> Shizu thought.</p>
<p id="line_1042">The knight who guided Shizu was the same man who had escorted her during the day.</p>
<p id="line_1043">“Shizu-dono, your performance in the battle earlier was truly magnificent. Even that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to fear you—”</p>
<p id="line_1044">He spoke enthusiastically, but Shizu felt uncomfortable under his respectful gaze. She decided to correct him clearly.</p>
<p id="line_1045">“No, I survived because I was lucky. That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was stronger than me.”</p>
<p id="line_1046">“Here you go again with modesty. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lost an arm and fled quickly, didn’t it? Although it was unfortunate that it escaped, as long as we have you, Shizu-dono, that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is nothing to fear!”</p>
<p id="line_1047">The knight’s youthful confidence was evident. Despite witnessing such a formidable threat, he seemed convinced they would win next time.</p>
<p id="line_1048"><em>Are the country’s leaders properly informed? If they share this knight’s perspective, they might be in serious danger next time.</em></p>
<p id="line_1049">Shizu was exasperated by the thought but reminded herself that she would have the opportunity to provide the correct explanation.</p>
<p id="line_1050"><em>Thinking about it, I was indeed lucky,</em> Shizu thought, as she arrived at the room where the king awaited. It was an underground space, the most heavily guarded area in the castle. As Shizu entered the room, the heavy door closed behind her. The knight who had guided her walked further in and took a seat on one of the three chairs arranged there. The remaining two chairs were occupied by an imposing man who appeared to be the king and the minister from earlier.</p>
<p id="line_1051">“…?”</p>
<p id="line_1052">At that moment, an alarm bell rang in Shizu’s mind. The situation was clearly unnatural, no matter how she looked at it. There was no one outside the door. Furthermore, it was inappropriate for the knight to sit down without first greeting the king.</p>
<p id="line_1053"><em>Come to think of it, I didn’t see this knight in the great hall… So why does he seem to know so much about my actions, as if he witnessed them firsthand?</em></p>
<p id="line_1054">Shizu, exhausted, realized that the knight had not been present during the earlier events.</p>
<p id="line_1055">“Thank you for coming, Shizu-dono. As the king, I appreciate your willingness to sacrifice yourself for the country.”</p>
<p id="line_1056">“What are you saying…?”</p>
<p id="line_1057">“You’re slow on the uptake, I see. You must be exhausted from the battle with the intruder, right? So now, we want you to be a sacrifice for the sake of our country’s guardian, while we have the chance.”</p>
<p id="line_1058">“…!”</p>
<p id="line_1059">With those words from the minister, Shizu finally understood she had been set up. The unease she had felt from the beginning made sense now. Being assigned a room isolated from other adventurers. When she considered the treatment of adventurers in the great hall, it seemed unnaturally suspicious. What if their true intention wasn’t to defeat the resurrected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but to offer sacrifices instead?</p>
<p id="line_1060">“I see. You were in on it from the beginning, weren’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_1061">“Correct.”</p>
<p id="line_1062">The knight who had guided Shizu replied with a bright smile.</p>
<p id="line_1063">“My name is Orthos. I’m the national knight Orthos, hailed as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and the ruler who governs this land.”</p>
<p id="line_1064">“—I see now. You weren’t sealed away from the beginning; you were free to act as you pleased in this land. You’re not just any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—you’re an enemy of humanity, a devilkin, right?”</p>
<p id="line_1065">Upon Shizu’s inquiry, Orthos grinned broadly. That sly grin was the answer itself.</p>
<p id="line_1066">It was all an elaborate hoax, a trap orchestrated by the nation. They had summoned renowned adventurers only to eliminate them, seize their equipment, and offer their bodies to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—devilkin. In doing so, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gained even more power. This country was ruled by devilkin, with the king as nothing more than a puppet.</p>
<p id="line_1067">Orthos said, “Exactly. I ‘saw’ your battle through the minister’s eyes. That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was formidable, but its end was anticlimactic. What surprised me more was your mask. It seems to be a magic item of considerable value. That’s exactly what I deserve to possess. I’ll drink your blood, devour your flesh, and your power will become mine as well,” and sneered, “You must be thrilled?”</p>
<p id="line_1068"><em>Don’t mess with me</em>, Shizu thought.</p>
<p id="line_1069">“I won’t let the likes of a devilkin run rampant! I’ll crush your pathetic schemes right here!”</p>
<p id="line_1070">“Hahahaha, fool! Your wounds from the battle haven’t healed, and your mana hasn’t recovered. Do you really think you can defeat me in that state?!”</p>
<p id="line_1071">As Orthos said, Shizu was far from being in perfect condition. She regretted her carelessness and realized she hadn’t questioned the summons from the king. Facing the worst enemy without any preparation was a fatal mistake for an adventurer like her. Now that it had come to this, escaping wouldn’t be easy. Dragging out the conversation wouldn’t improve her chances. Waiting until morning might bring reinforcements, but the night had only just begun.</p>
<p id="line_1072">With that in mind, Shizu decided it was better to confront Orthos than to attempt escape. Resolute, Shizu moved swiftly. Without a word, she put everything into her first strike.</p>
<p id="line_1073">“Too slow!”</p>
<p id="line_1074">Shizu’s sword, wreathed in flames, lunged toward Orthos’s neck. Yet, Orthos was faster. He intercepted the blade with his left arm.</p>
<p id="line_1075">“Urk!”</p>
<p id="line_1076">“Oh? To think you’d wound me. You seem stronger than the last duo I faced.”</p>
<p id="line_1077">“As expected, you did kill the Silver Wings…”</p>
<p id="line_1078">“Of course. Although I admit, I was careless and allowed them to escape. I’ve learned from that mistake, which is why I’ve relocated to these underground chambers.”</p>
<p id="line_1079">Previously, Orthos had lured the Silver Wings to the back garden to avoid public attention, but the Silver had managed to escape through an Outsider-Repelling Barrier. Orthos, reflecting on that blunder, chose to conduct his hunt in the underground chambers this time. Orthos knew Shizu was unlikely to escape due to this setup, which is why he chose to torment her rather than kill her outright.</p>
<p id="line_1080">Orthos, being a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who thrived on the fear people experienced, began speaking about himself in a way designed to instill despair in Shizu. “Do you know? Even among <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there are ranks.”</p>
<p id="line_1081">“Like lesser and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s?”</p>
<p id="line_1082">“Yes, that’s right. Above them are the legendary beings known as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.”</p>
<p id="line_1083">“…”</p>
<p id="line_1084">“Ku-ku-ku, indeed. I am one of those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s!”</p>
<p id="line_1085">Orthos’s laughter was meant to deepen Shizu’s despair. It was unfortunate that her frightened face was hidden behind the mask, but for Orthos, simply boasting about his greatness was enough to satisfy him.</p>
<p id="line_1086">Originally a mere <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="lesser demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Orthos had been fortunate enough to obtain a physical body. Upon awakening an ego, he pursued his ambitions, constantly striving for greater power. By allying with the devilkin, he gained strength and evolved into a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Disguised as a soldier, he infiltrated the country and eventually ascended to the rank of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> by stealing a ‘name.’</p>
<p id="line_1087">“Do you understand? Having artificially become a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the voices of the people in this country have become my strength. That strength bestowed a name upon me. With my own power, I became Named. Yes, just like that esteemed individual who stands at the pinnacle of our lineage.”</p>
<p id="line_1088">“…What are you saying?”</p>
<p id="line_1089">“Ku-ku-ku, you ignorant fool, there are things you do not know. But never mind. What is clear is that even if you perform Fusion with Ifrit, your power is insufficient to defeat me!”</p>
<p id="line_1090">Orthos’s declaration was accompanied by his boisterous laughter. Thus, the one-sided battle began.</p>
<p id="line_1091">Orthos pummeled Shizu with brutal punches and kicks, relishing in the violence but deliberately avoiding a fatal blow. Shizu focused desperately on defense, trying to minimize damage, but the fatigue from the earlier battle compounded her struggles. The difference in power was overwhelming. Shizu’s movements grew slower.</p>
<p id="line_1092"><em>This is the worst. If it weren’t for the battle earlier, things might have been different…</em> Shizu thought, but voicing such thoughts would only sound like excuses for her failure.</p>
<p id="line_1093">“Ha-ha-ha-ha! Even someone called a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has only this much power! What’s wrong? Won’t you Fuse with Ifrit? If you do, maybe you’ll be able to put up a slightly better fight, don’t you think?” Orthos taunted and showed a malicious grin. He knew Shizu’s strength was almost depleted.</p>
<p id="line_1094">Suppressing her frustration, Shizu kept her guard up, determined not to give in. There was no hope. She resolved to drag the fight out a little longer, looking for one chance to strike back. As Orthos began to gather mana in his right hand, preparing a fatal blow, Shizu allowed herself a faint smile.</p>
<p id="line_1095"><em>That composure is a sign of carelessness. My mana may be spent, but Ifrit’s power still lingers. If I let it run wild, it could destroy even an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!</em></p>
<p id="line_1096">That was Shizue’s ace in the hole. She was waiting for the moment when Orthos would get too confident and let his guard down, planning for a mutual destruction. But the battle was not to end as she planned.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1097">“How troublesome. To think that someone like you, who has caused me pain, would be killed by such trash.”</p>
<p id="line_1098">A cheerful voice echoed through the chamber, halting Orthos’s movements. Orthos turned towards the source of the voice. The king and the minister, confident of Orthos’s victory, wore malicious smiles. Behind them, unnoticed until now, stood a handsome man dressed in jet-black attire. It was Kuro.</p>
<p id="line_1099">“Y-you are…”</p>
<p id="line_1100">In response to Shizu’s involuntary murmur, Kuro gave a soft but cold smile.</p>
<p id="line_1101">“You know, I am someone who always keeps promises.”</p>
<p id="line_1102">With those words, Kuro swiftly tossed several heads toward the king and the minister.</p>
<p id="line_1103">“T-these are the parasitic soldiers’—?!”</p>
<p id="line_1104">“Nonsense. My knights, who boast unparalleled strength, were killed?”</p>
<p id="line_1105">Seeing the astonished expressions of the king and the minister, Kuro declared with a bored tone, “Just because you parasitized some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="lesser demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, you think that’s unparalleled strength? Your standards of strength are so low, it’s hardly worth discussing.”</p>
<p id="line_1106">The king and the minister were outraged by Kuro’s words.</p>
<p id="line_1107">“Fool! We witnessed your strength earlier. Indeed, formidable, but still not our match!”</p>
<p id="line_1108">“Also, you think you can defeat us with just one arm—”</p>
<p id="line_1109">Splat.</p>
<p id="line_1110">Kuro was merciless toward uninteresting opponents. Without waiting for the minister to finish, he crushed his head with a single hand.</p>
<p id="line_1111">“I-impossible! The minister was protected by a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like I am! Kuh, in that case—”</p>
<p id="line_1112">In a desperate move, the king turned his back to Kuro and hastily grabbed several weapons prepared beforehand.</p>
<p id="line_1113">“Behold! These are the numerous treasures we seized after killing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. With these, you’re nothing—”</p>
<p id="line_1114">These were the king’s final words.</p>
<p id="line_1115">Whether his opponent was the king of a nation or not, Kuro did not hesitate. Like any nameless foot soldier, if they were in his way, he would simply eliminate them. The king’s corpse toppled over, and numerous treasures scattered across the floor. Even if these treasures were the culmination of centuries of wrongdoing in this country, they did not pique Kuro’s interest.</p>
<p id="line_1116">“Don’t chirp, trash. Gathering this kind of junk to adorn fodder won’t make you my enemy,” he said with a mocking tone.</p>
<p id="line_1117">Shizu could hardly believe what was happening right before her eyes. The heads Kuro threw belonged to the knights of the country. From their conversation, it was clear that these knights had been possessed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1118"><em>I didn’t expect him to flee, but this…</em></p>
<p id="line_1119">Shizue shuddered upon realizing that Kuro was hunting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that had possessed humans. Despite being injured during their battle—his right arm still not regenerated—Kuro’s face remained smug, as if the injury were of no concern.</p>
<p id="line_1120">“Fuha-hahaha! Don’t think that just because you’ve defeated my puppets, you can compare yourself to me, an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. A coarse <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like you is nothing more—”</p>
<p id="line_1121">“Who are you calling coarse?”</p>
<p id="line_1122">The smile vanished from Kuro’s face.</p>
<p id="line_1123">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_1124">In a blur, Kuro moved and began to strangle Orthos. To Shizu, it seemed as if Kuro had disappeared momentarily. Orthos appeared to perceive the same, letting out a foolish sound.</p>
<p id="line_1125">“<em>Red’s</em> kin are too overconfident. That’s why they can’t accurately gauge their opponent’s strength.”</p>
<p id="line_1126">It was a remark Kuro made to himself, not directed at anyone in particular. However, Orthos overheard and understood its implications all too well, filling him with despair.</p>
<p id="line_1127">“N-no way… You, no, Sire…”</p>
<p id="line_1128">“Someone as disgraceful as you, who allies with devilkin, has no right to live. I will destroy your soul so that you can never resurrect.”</p>
<p id="line_1129">“No, stop—?!”</p>
<p id="line_1130">There was no need to listen to Orthos’s excuses. Kuro’s rampage was entirely one-sided. And with that, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lurking within the Kingdom of Filtwood were completely eradicated.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1131">The next day, the discovery of the king and the minister’s corpses caused a commotion throughout the castle. Though the incident was hushed up, a dead <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also found in the basement. Naturally, the first to discover it was Shizu. Shizu chose not to reveal the full truth. Instead, the official record stated that “the deaths of the king and the minister were the work of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> known as Kuro. After a fierce battle, Shizu repelled the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1132">Kuro had proposed this deal: ‹If you tell this story, I will stop targeting you.›</p>
<p id="line_1133">Shizu accepted. She knew she couldn’t defeat Kuro and didn’t view him as merely an evil entity.</p>
<p id="line_1134">Not only Shizu but also the other adventurers were suspected as suspects. With the grave crime of regicide having occurred, it was an unavoidable situation. However, their suspicions were soon cleared when the king’s and minister’s wrongdoings were exposed through their remaining belongings. Remarkably, everything was hidden in a way that would ensure its immediate discovery.</p>
<p id="line_1135"><em>It’s undoubtedly Kuro’s doing.</em></p>
<p id="line_1136">Shizu, caught up in the incident, was firmly convinced of that.</p>
<p id="line_1137">With the truth revealed, Shizu and the adventurers received apologies and rewards, clearing them of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p id="line_1138">Several days later.</p>
<p id="line_1139">“So in the end, who was that guy Kuro?”</p>
<p id="line_1140">“I think it’s better not to know.”</p>
<p id="line_1141">“…Yeah, you’re right. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. Well then, I’m off; stay well, Shizu-san!”</p>
<p id="line_1142">With that, Cougar waved goodbye and walked away.</p>
<p id="line_1143">Shizue also closed the lid on that question in her heart. Shizu had her own duties, and that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> named Kuro was beyond her capabilities.</p>
<p id="line_1144"><em>Someone else will surely deal with that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> somehow</em>, she decided to optimistically hope.</p>
<p id="line_1145">Time passed.</p>
<p id="line_1146">The cracked mask fell away, revealing the face of a beautiful woman confronting a slime. It was Shizu and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> laughed upon seeing this scene. It was Kuro.</p>
<p id="line_1147">“Kufufufufu. To think that mask would crack. Indeed, that slime, that great being is—”</p>
<p id="line_1148">Just then, Kuro watched as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s hand regenerated the mask.</p>
<p id="line_1149">“I knew it. Kufufufufu!”</p>
<p id="line_1150">Kuro laughed, anticipating the end of his monotonous days. He eagerly awaited the day he would be summoned by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…</p>
