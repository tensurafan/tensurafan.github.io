He’s rather displeased with the summoning of ‘Otherworlders’ and strictly forbids it.

Leon himself thought that things would develop in that direction sooner or later.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_71"><span class="indent">Honestly, there was too much uncertainty with this method. The rate of success was astronomically low. It was an approach that was unlikely to work from the start.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_72"><span class="indent">After all, this was about summoning a specific individual to this world—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_73"><span class="indent">He had ordered his subordinates to do the summoning countless times. It took more than thirty summoners working together in the span of seven days of rituals with detailed procedures to do the summoning to Leon’s specific criteria.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_74"><span class="indent">Yet the rate of success was less than one percent. Moreover, it would take some time for the same person to conduct the summoning ritual again, and the number of times a person could attempt the ritual was also limited.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_75"><span class="indent">From the start, the rate of success was close to zero.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_76"><span class="indent">Even Leon himself had conducted many summons, yet they all ended in failure. His last summon called upon Shizue Izawa, and tomorrow, it would be sixty-six years since she was summoned. If he wanted to narrow down the conditions into the summoning rituals, the interval between summons would be even longer.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_77"><span class="indent">The next summon was not worth looking forward to, either. That was why he devised the ‘Incomplete Summoning’ rituals. It was a young girl that Leon was looking for. That was why the incomplete summon, which had a higher chance of summoning children, should raise his rate of success, even though it would be barely noticeable in the grand scheme of things.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_78"><span class="indent">He planned to spread the method among the Western Nations, thereby increasing the chance of success by raising the number of summons attempted and thus gathering more children…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_79"><span class="indent">—Yet to this day, it had been a complete failure.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_80"><span class="indent">There was no other way, and he could not think of any other alternatives.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_81"><span class="indent">That anxious uneasiness weighed heavily on his heart. Regardless, Leon spoke in his usual cold monotone: “—<span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> you say? We have not signed an agreement nor asked for any aid. But in the end, he became the hindrance. Still, that’s something that can’t be helped. However, what did you mean by our trade will be suspended? Even if the West has fallen, wouldn’t the East still be operating?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_82"><span class="indent">Leon’s sonorous voice echoed in the meeting hall. There was an intense pressure in his voice. <span data-term="Tear" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t help but feel numb after being hit by his voice head-on.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_83"><span class="indent">They were on different levels.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_84"><span class="indent">A half-baked <span data-term="majin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would have problems just standing still in front of a <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

They seem to be secretly preparing for war, so their mages are quite occupied. That’s why it’s not as easy to gather people needed for conducting rituals.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_87"><span class="indent">Leon squinted at Laplace after listening to what he had to say.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_88"><span class="italic indent">How annoying</span><span class="indent">, he thought to himself.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_89"><span class="indent">He didn’t care about what happened between the Western Nations and the Eastern Empire; but if the war were to be lengthy, it would impact Leon’s goals. If this were to be the case, he would need to re-examine his plans.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_90"><span class="indent">With that being said, these thoughts were all in Leon’s head. He was still sitting on his throne with a cold expression, silently glaring at Laplace.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_91"><span class="indent">His gaze made Laplace rather uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_92"><span class="italic indent">This guy is definitely a pain in the ass to deal with.

The real deal really is different, no? Just like Boss said, it’s not gonna be easy to seek revenge against this guy directly…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_93"><span class="indent">Due to <span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s orders, they had been keeping a low profile. So even with the person who killed Kazaream standing in front of him, Laplace didn’t have the slightest intention to take on <span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon.

He wanted to do his job well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_94"><span class="indent">But, even if that were to be the case—with their archnemesis in front him, he could still try to measure his strength and find his weaknesses.

If he were to battle against him seriously… There was no telling who would come out on top. Perhaps he would win, perhaps he would lose.

It’s fine if there is only one slot. However, if you put a wind spirit next to a fire spirit, the overall magic power intensifies. In contrast, a water spirit combined with a fire spirit reduces power. Even so, one water spirit marble paired with two fire spirit marbles results in a dramatic spike in power.

However, I didn’t know what would happen if Milim kept running away from her responsibilities.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_701"><span class="indent">But that was someone else’s business, which I preferred to stay away from and rather observe.

In addition, we even switched our avatars to automatic mode and let them explore with Gaia together. It was a fantastic way of allowing Gaia to keep on training.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_704"><span class="indent">It was still too early for Milim to directly coach it.

There were rumors among the challengers—these bosses appeared to have two levels of strength.

While most of my work could be handled by people like Rigurd to some extent, the important decisions had to be reviewed by me personally.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_717"><span class="indent">I had a great deal of authority.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_718"><span class="indent">To put it bluntly, I could manipulate the judicial, legislative and executive powers at will. This was because I held the absolute right to control these three powers—and so, I held absolute power over the nation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_719"><span class="indent">I was even overseeing military command, which could be considered the cornerstone of this nation. I could march our army with a single order. The appointment of any officers had to be approved by me as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_720"><span class="indent">The word “Federation” was purely superficial; in truth, this was no different than a dictatorship run by me.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_721"><span class="indent">But in reality, I just tossed all my work to other people.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_722"><span class="indent">Administrative matters were handled entirely by Rigurd, while in terms of the military, <span data-term="Benimaru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was acting on my behalf and held full control over it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_723"><span class="indent">We were currently recruiting talents to serve as their aides.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_724"><span class="indent">Rigurd was learning about the separation of powers, whereas the former goblins chiefs, Rugurd, Regurd and Rogurd were acting as the head of the Judicial, Legislative and Executive branches, respectively. Nevertheless, there was a slight problem here—separation of powers could not be maintained without some kind of oversight.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_725"><span class="indent">Similar to Japan’s parliamentary cabinet system, the boundary between the legislative and executive was blurred. It was difficult foreseeing what correct measures I had to take in order to improve this problem.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_726"><span class="indent">Anyway, we began setting up the Legislative branch.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_727"><span class="indent">Regarding that, our nation settled on creating a Senate and a House of Representatives. Senators from the Senate would be appointed by me while the representatives from the House of Representatives would be elected through public elections.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_728"><span class="indent">The senators would not change. They would be allowed to continue serving forever unless they fell from grace by getting in any kind of trouble.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_729"><span class="indent">On the other hand, the representatives from the House of Representatives would be elected by the public. Holding an election wouldn’t be easy. It was going to require a lot of trial and error.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_730"><span class="indent">The Legislative branch would only be in charge of drafting laws.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_731"><span class="indent">Then, the Executive branch would be in charge of carrying out the charted laws and see to it that the nation operated accordingly. I wanted to have someone talented in order to solidify our Executive branch.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_732"><span class="indent">Using the Japanese bureaucracy as an example, even with the prime ministers constantly changing over and over, the nation still functioned very solidly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_733"><span class="indent">Although there have been more and more problems in recent years…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_734"><span class="indent">Anyhow, we must be practical and push forward our policies gradually. We needed someone who possessed tenacity and diligence so that they wouldn’t give up so easily during the execution of our laws. However, long-term plans tended to waste unnecessary resources, and perhaps officials might be bribed to do bad things, so I wanted to prevent this kind of thing from happening by closely monitoring them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_735"><span class="indent">As for the first wave of officials to take office in the Executive branch, I intended to select them from the pool of goblin tribe chiefs in Tempest Federation. The elders, on the other hand, were to be elected by proxy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_736"><span class="indent">In this regard, I believed it would eventually turn into a meritocracy. We were still in the process of reconciling the stakes and rivalries of each tribe, but I hoped that in the future, we would be able to unite together as one. Although it would also take time for us to do so, I wanted our nation to pursue a policy of peaceful reconciliation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_737"><span class="indent">Leaving that aside, there was a problem here.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_738"><span class="indent">Those who were good at governmental duties tended to be mostly weaker races, whereas those who were at the top of the militant races were not good with the paperwork.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_739"><span class="indent">This was a troubling issue.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_740"><span class="indent">Should we focus on the strength within the <span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> world, or focus on the coexistence with humanity, knowledge and coordination? It was quite the conundrum.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_741"><span class="indent">No matter how strong some people were, I wasn’t going to tolerate criminals; this was already well known to us. In addition, the military honestly had bragging rights to the sheer power they possessed. However, that didn’t mean they could interfere with the country’s operating policy. Depending on the future policies, I was afraid that it might cause discontentment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_742"><span class="indent">Legislation, at its core, was gathering the opinions of the people, drafting them into law, and having it approved by the Executive.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_743"><span class="indent">However, at the Executive level, even the weak could control power by using their wits, and the strong could be deprived of their rights.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_744"><span class="indent">Wouldn’t some people have a problem with that? This was to be expected at this stage.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_745"><span class="indent">After all, the Executive played an important role.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_746"><span class="indent">The Executive branch had the responsibility of managing the national budget, and the vast amount of wealth amassed in <span data-term="the Tempest Federation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be put to use by public officials. <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was our top financial functionary, but he alone could not uncover every single case of corruption and fraud.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_747"><span class="indent">Moreover, the division of territories also fell under Executive control. I expected that appointments would be made to develop regions at the appropriate time, but that plan might also become a point of contention. To prevent this from happening, all decrees would be issued in my name.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_748"><span class="indent">Finally, there was the Judicial Branch.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_749"><span class="indent">The most important work of the Judicial Branch was to try people who had been arrested and charged with a crime.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_750"><span class="indent">Police power was vested in the Executive Branch; yet, the power of arrest was not limited to only the Executive, but also to the Legislative and Judicial Branches. The purpose was, of course, mutual oversight.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_751"><span class="indent">The judiciary was responsible for sanctioning persons that were under arrest.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_752"><span class="indent">It was the Judicial Branch that required the highest regard for impartiality, and to protect the order of law without being swayed by the opinions of the people. Relying on the law to punish without mercy—that was surprisingly difficult.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_753"><span class="indent">I was also troubled by the question of how to guarantee a fair and just trial.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_754"><span class="indent">In any case, in order to implement the separation of powers once and for all, I was learning alongside Rigurd. The people’s voices must be heard, and legislation must be discussed and enacted together. It was essential to establish a transparent political system.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_755"><span class="indent">In terms of administration, Rigurd and other talented people were currently being selected as officials and were training to become bureaucrats. In order to strengthen the authority of the central government, it was necessary to create a law enforcement agency as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_756"><span class="indent">The military, under <span data-term="Benimaru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s direct control, and the intelligence agency “Dark Shadow” led by <span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, would answer only to my commands. In order to prevent chaos in the chain of command, it was decided that they would not listen to any orders from the Executive Branch. Therefore, I was planning to appoint someone quite powerful as the head of the Public Prosecutor’s Office.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_757"><span class="indent">There was another thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_758"><span class="indent">The judiciary also had problems.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_759"><span class="indent">Conducting trials could easily stoke violence and resentment on all sides. This demanded not only smarts, but a certain amount of adroitness to get the job done.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_760"><span class="indent">Of course, judges needed protection, but that thought alone was disturbing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_761"><span class="indent">Purposefully attacking a judge for the sake of revenge was absolutely intolerable, and was grounds for an immediate death sentence. However, we couldn’t rule out the possibility of someone being aware of the consequences and still committing a crime like that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_762"><span class="indent">Unlike humans, <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were tough. No matter how discrete the security was, officials were susceptible to ambushes. That was why we wanted our judge to have some personal physical strength.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_763"><span class="indent">“Uh—in that case, relying on Rugurd alone is rather concerning,” I admitted.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_764"><span class="indent">Rigurd agreed with my view. “Right. Even though he is my close lieutenant, he’s not as strong as a centurion. If we switched to Rogurd however, he wouldn’t lose to any average youngsters…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_765"><span class="indent">Rugurd had a deep and ruthless side, but could deliver an honest verdict. Good for a judge, but not powerful enough to protect himself when things went wrong.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_766"><span class="indent">Rogurd was a strong man, and can take on a thousand captains one-on-one. However, he was spearheading all the ministries and departments in the Executive Branch in place of Rigurd, and therefore it would be difficult for him to transfer over to the Judicial Branch.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_767"><span class="indent">I pondered for a bit. “I would like to set up a prosecutor’s office within the Executive Branch. If it’s a domestic crime, <span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the security force will be able to stop it, but when it comes to cracking down on executives and lawmakers, it’s too much of a burden for those guys, isn’t it?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_768"><span class="indent">“Indeed, you’re right.

Construction could be carried out with different phases of planning to maximize efficiency. Furthermore, this was a fantastic training opportunity for our field engineers, which was why we arranged field officers to lead each team and let them give orders at their discretion.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_822"><span class="indent">To be more specific, there were four locations with construction occurring—the outskirts of Dwargon, <span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span data-term="Yuurazania" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_823"><span class="indent">The one near Dwargon had already been connected with a highway, with inns lining it. The goal of the current project was to widen the road and lay down tracks, specifically for the ‘Magic Train’. We also hired adventurers as paid labor. Because of the job offer, it had quite the surge of popularity. The site was full of energy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_824"><span class="indent">On the <span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> side, it was just like Dwargon’s route.

For now, we had everyone working on jobs such as widening the road while preserving the natural environment. The wood cut down from the process would be transported to the new but still under construction capital. That was why we had been making arrangements so that the supplies could be shipped out at a faster pace.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_826"><span class="indent">The road leading to <span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, on the other hand, was not progressing so smoothly. We initially began with cutting down forests, but it was taking more time than expected. The main workforce there consisted of high orcs. They could use ‘Stomach’ to transport material. As they were the most skillful of workers, the task of widening the road should have posed no problems.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_827"><span class="indent">However, they were also required to transport the wood they had cut down. This type of work required more manpower, which would only be sufficient by the time the operation in <span data-term="Yuurazania" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was complete and the two construction crews rendezvoused.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_828"><span class="indent">First, our workers needed to be able to traverse the forest. After which, we planned to gradually build and then pave the road. We would only start drilling the tunnels and laying down tracks after everything was complete.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_829"><span class="indent">This was the current situation on our four main fronts.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_830"><span class="indent">Some people were against the idea of running the ‘Magic Train’ to the Armored Nation Dwargon. They claimed that predicting the movements of the Eastern Empire was impossible, and that there was a possibility of information leakage.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_831"><span class="indent">Furthermore, they were afraid that the Eastern Empire would steal the ‘Magic Train’ and repurpose it for military invasion. In that way, the ‘Magic Train’ tracks we went through all the trouble of laying down could turn out to be a double-edged sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_832"><span class="indent">Others were also worried that the route was going to be sabotaged.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_833"><span class="indent">Some even suggested that “We should build a fortress to face the Empire”.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_834"><span class="indent">The inn town near Ameld river had a large residential area.

I thought it was meaningless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_835"><span class="indent">Right now, we still had no idea what the Eastern Empire would do. The thought of adding more to our growing pile of work definitely put me off. Even though we had more manpower these days, there were still a ton of things that needed to be done.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_836"><span class="indent">However, this did not mean that we were being careless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_837"><span class="indent">It wasn’t that we were sitting idly by with the assumption that the Eastern Empire wouldn’t launch a preemptive strike, but rather that if the other side did seriously attack us, then we would simply do our best to crush our enemies. I did not want to continue dealing with them with a facade, and it was incredibly foolish maintaining a high level of vigilance all the time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_838"><span class="indent">It depended on how the Empire came at us, but we intended to meet their challenge with full strength and force a short yet decisive victory. Among our ranks, some of our lieutenants also agreed to this more direct approach.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_839"><span class="indent">By the time the war began, the train tracks, among other things, that we spent so much time putting down would likely be destroyed. However, even if that turned out to be the case, we could always construct them again. We should not delay the progress of our development just because we were afraid of something that might happen in the future.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_840"><span class="indent">The same goes for the angels’ invasion.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_841"><span class="indent">No matter who our opponent was, we would not back down.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_842"><span class="indent">We will roll with the punches when the time comes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_843"><span class="indent">We would simply have to rebuild what was ruined.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_844"><span class="indent">While it was crucial to think about how to protect these things, people were more important, not objects. As long as we protected the craftsman, then everything would turn out fine.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_845"><span class="indent">With this resolve in mind, the construction and development of the projects were carried out at an incredible pace, thanks to sheer determination and planning.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_846"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Even though Ramiris herself was not that menacing, her assistant Beretta and <span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san would not sit still to any rudeness directed at their master.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_947"><span class="indent">The arrogant ones’ demise was truly tragic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_948"><span class="indent">“Oi, where’s my tea?” a certain annoying dragon demanded.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_949"><span class="indent">“Yes—right away—!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_950"><span class="indent">“Ahh, what a rough day. My shoulders are so stiff,” a certain annoying fairy sighed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_951"><span class="indent">“Please allow me to give you a massage—!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_952"><span class="italic indent">What are these ‘Surmounters’ even…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_953"><span class="indent">“Oh, these stupid idiots, you’re useless!” the leader of the vampires lamented, but at least he didn’t complain about this to Veldora or Ramiris.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_954"><span class="indent">And so, they had a surprisingly smooth time integrating with everyone.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_955"><span class="indent">What they were researching was even more interesting. The vampires’ research was the polar opposite of ‘Magic Science’. <span data-term="Ruminas" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> labeled their research as “useless”, but I disagreed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_956"><span class="indent">The research the vampires were undertaking was exactly the same as ‘Engineering Physics’ back on Earth. It was devoid of any magical components and instead tried to discover the laws of the natural world. By jotting down detailed records of natural phenomena, they would then turn them into physical laws. This was the essence of their study.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_957"><span class="indent">They always wound up obtaining the same outcome, regardless of who the researcher was at the time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_958"><span class="indent">In some sense, it was to be expected, but there were also many variants due to the many magical phenomena in this world. In a way, this field of study could be considered unorthodox.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_959"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Ruminas" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to like it, but I believed it was quite interesting.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_960"><span class="indent">To be honest, the recording of data was a means to kill time to the vampires, but this huge collection of data was significant. If we were to use this data as a foundation, we could investigate the influence of magic on the world much more easily.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_961"><span class="indent">A breakthrough in science often came from the accumulation of small, minor discoveries over time. Therefore, what they were researching should not be underestimated.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_962"><span class="indent">And so, we managed to bring scholars of varying fields to our nation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_963"><span class="indent">The knowledge they carried over was immeasurable, and the research findings as a result of this academic exchange would prove to be invaluable. We needed to ensure the personal safety of every researcher, in addition to keeping the outcome of their research confidential. That was the duty our nation had to uphold.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_964"><span class="indent">The researchers working here were wearing specially-designed bracelets. It was a fine gadget that Ramiris made, which removed the numerical limit on the traditional ‘<span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’. It also included functions such as communication and teleportation within the labyrinth, though the preset teleportation destinations were only the surface and the research facility.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_965"><span class="indent">Since the researchers had to keep all sorts of secrets, we had to inconvenience them on some matters. Based on these considerations, we gave away these items for free.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_966"><span class="indent">They could only access the predesignated locations and couldn’t move between floors or teleport to other areas. Moreover, once they teleported, relevant data about the user would be recorded to prevent any information leak.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_967"><span class="indent">Although, they still had other means to move around; for instance, asking the dryads to help teleport them. In that regard, they needed <span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s direct approval. All in all, there shouldn’t be any way to conduct espionage activities within the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_968"><span class="indent">Technically speaking, however, the ‘Surmounters’ might have other methods of breaking these restrictions, but doing so could be dangerous for them. Even I had no idea the exact types of traps that were set in the labyrinth, so it wouldn’t be easy for these vampires to try and break through them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_969"><span class="indent">Furthermore, all of their activities were being monitored, so if they were up to some dishonest activities, we could immediately pursue them. And if they got stuck in parts of the labyrinth, we could easily apprehend them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_970"><span class="indent">There were reasons for such strict regulations.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_971"><span class="indent">I had been informed that highly developed civilizations tend to attract attacks from the angels—and that was the main reason why we had prepared so thoroughly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_972"><span class="indent">In that regard alone, there was no safer place than Ramiris’s labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_973"><span class="indent">Inside there—specifically, the ninety-fifth floor of the labyrinth—it should be possible to stop even the angels’ invasion. Ramiris bragged that if anything were to happen, she could switch the floors instantly, exchanging floor ninety-five for floor ninety-nine.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_974"><span class="indent">This deep city within the labyrinth was likely the safest place in all of Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_975"><span class="indent">In order to prevent secrets from leaking, this place was completely isolated. On top of that, the labyrinth also provided the perfect environment for the welfare of the staff, including health care, so the labyrinth was a great living environment too.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_976"><span class="indent">The ninety-fifth floor had some of the most luxurious service facilities in our nation, so I figured that would be enough to satisfy the researchers.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_977"><span class="indent">By the way—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_978"><span class="indent">While the sealed cave was considered as a major research site in the past, it had been shut down. The prolonged planting of hipokute herbs caused the concentration of magicules to drop drastically within the cave. Therefore, even though the concentration was still relatively high, the product yield would naturally not be as ideal. That was why we decided to move the hipokute plantation to a different location.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_979"><span class="indent">With that being said, we had already planned to transform the flower field on floor ninety-three to a special zone for growing hipokute herbs. We would merely increase the magicule concentration on the floor in order to mutate the weeds.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_980"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others’ research facility was moved underground to the hundredth floor too, since one of the reasons why the plantation moved was for conveniences’ sake.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_981"><span class="indent">The sealed cave was excavated all the way to the back of the mountain and became a residence for the wyverns. Since that was considered a military secret, we had completely shut down the location, preventing any ordinary citizens from entering. All vital research would be conducted within the labyrinth in the future.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_982"><span class="indent">As I suspected, the two were bringing me to the ninety-fifth floor’s research facility.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_983"><span class="indent">The fact that we weren’t heading to their private chambers appeared to suggest we were reviewing the results from our joint research agreement. They did mention a prototype, so it seemed that the research was going smoothly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_984"><span class="indent">It looked like our key item would be ready just in time for the railroad tracks to open.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_985"><span class="indent">The ninety-fifth floor, which I hadn’t visited in a while, had gradually become a forest-type city before I knew it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_986"><span class="indent">In this beautifully maintained park, the cityscape seemed to mesh perfectly with the surrounding trees.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_987"><span class="indent">I always wondered how they managed to erect such a large city, but considering some of the elves had once lived in the forest, this was probably the manifestation of their wisdom.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_988"><span class="indent">The Treants seemed to have also helped build this wonderful place.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_989"><span class="indent">Naturally, the challengers who only briefly visited the labyrinth were barred from entering this hidden town. Only those who had challenged the labyrinth under official rules earned the right to enter the city.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_990"><span class="indent">I stopped by the elven cabaret quite often myself, but I seldom visited them in the morning. That’s why I didn’t expect this place to change so much.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_991"><span class="indent">I had been leaving everything in Veldora and Ramiris’s hands, and this result was very interesting. The other floors seemed to have undergone drastic changes too. I couldn’t help but anticipate a more casual trip to the labyrinth in the future.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_992"><span class="indent">With that in mind, I continued to follow the two.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_993"><span class="indent">Soon, I laid eyes on the research facility in the center of the park. The building was constructed from reinforced concrete, so it was rather jarring. There were also many large buildings adjacent to the main facility. We also had a dormitory for the foreign researchers to sleep in. For some reason, these supposedly brand-new buildings built under my supervision looked a bit ancient. However, it did give off a rather unique air, so I guess that was okay.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_994"><span class="indent">“It’s so quaint with all these trees nearby,” Ramiris gushed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_995"><span class="indent">“Right? A research facility obviously needs an aura of mystery!” Veldora declared proudly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_996"><span class="italic indent">What ‘aura of mystery’ are you talking about? They’re like a bunch of kids joyfully building their secret base. Where did you learn all this bizarre stuff?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_997"><span class="indent">“Everyone’s getting along well, we were even thinking about forming a secret society!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_998"><span class="italic indent">Secret society?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_999"><span class="italic indent">What the hell have you guys been doing here?!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1000"><span class="indent">“Hehehe, wasn’t <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the first one to reveal everyone’s research results? Some people originally wanted to steal other nations’ technology, but because of what you did, they were finally able to turn back on the right path.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1001"><span class="indent">I never expected this.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1002"><span class="indent">There were huge barriers between nations, and researchers from different countries were no different, since they all had contrasting opinions. Each had their home nations’ best interests in mind, and some planned to absorb the technology of others while keeping their own hidden.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1003"><span class="indent">I figured this joint research wasn’t going to work if that happened, and so I decided to expose everyone’s technology in one go.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1004"><span class="indent">In the eyes of Raphael-sensei, there was no such thing as “secret technology”. I summarized everything so that it was easy to understand, like some kind of official manual, and handed everyone a copy. I had generously used up all the expensive paper that <span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> helped prepare for me. Although it was a little wasteful, I deemed it a necessary loss.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1005"><span class="indent">As opposed to parchment, I wanted to record information on paper that was made from plant fibers. The paper given to me by <span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared to be manufactured by the Empire, though its quality was almost the same as paper produced on Earth. I was sure everyone saw my seriousness after using all this valuable paper. After the incident, the researchers became very open with one another. Everyone was cooperating out of pure desire to fulfill their intellectual curiosity.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1006"><span class="indent">“Ohh, you compiled confidential information from every nation involved and made it into a data book so everyone could read it, didn’t you? Even though people were very vocal about it at the time, I thought it would lead to new technologies being developed.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1007"><span class="indent">“Umm umm, we share just this thought with <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! We later held a recognition-of-service party and everyone found a kindred spirit in each other,” added Ramiris.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1008"><span class="indent">Consequently, researchers gave up on trying to hide their technological secrets and began cooperating with each other; strangely enough, an unusual sense of solidarity quickly developed within the research facility. It seemed that everyone was no longer just thinking about their home nation. Even the ‘Surmounter’ vampires had become companions that considered themselves to be our equal.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1009"><span class="indent">Things were getting interesting.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1010"><span class="indent">This was good.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1011"><span class="indent">Yet despite this fantastic outcome, there was a problem.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1012"><span class="indent">The researchers gradually formed the structure of a community, which was led by Veldora and Ramiris. That might be the reason why an independent organization was formed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1013"><span class="indent">That’s right.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1014"><span class="indent">It was like some sort of evil secret society, where everyone could enjoy researching the things they truly liked. It was quite the mysterious environment. Ramiris was especially interested in the various fields of research. She eventually became the group’s mascot and idol. Veldora, on the other hand, became the evil ringleader.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1015"><span class="italic indent">These guys seriously did this while I was gone…</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;With that being said, I figured if I was here, they would probably do something </span><span class="italic indent">even more</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;outrageous.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1016"><span class="italic indent">—No, that can’t be true.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1017"><span class="indent">With that thought in mind, I continued my conversation with them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1018"><span class="indent">“So that’s why the place now looks like this.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1019"><span class="indent">“How about it? Isn’t it cool, having an evil secret base?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1020"><span class="italic indent">Ah, just as I suspected. It really is a secret base.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1021"><span class="indent">Veldora’s source of information was mainly reproduced from my memories. That explained why the research facility looked the way it did, straight from manga and other sources. As a result, my intuition regarding the reasons behind his actions was often the right answer.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1022"><span class="indent">“Tsk, you guys sure were having fun by yourselves.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1023"><span class="indent">“GAHAHAHA! It’s nothing really. What comes next is the important part. We will need your wisdom in the future.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1024"><span class="indent">“That’s right, <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! You always give us a scare. Now it’s our turn to surprise you. Take a look at our research first before you share your opinion.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1025"><span class="indent">Hearing the accidental slip of my genuine thoughts, Veldora laughed out loud while Ramiris tried to comfort me.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1026"><span class="indent">I shouldn’t sulk after what she said.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1027"><span class="indent">I regained my composure and followed the two into the facility.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1028"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Did that surprise you?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1035"><span class="indent">It was none other than Kaijin. He was acting chief director, and he had on a rather unfitting white lab coat.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1036"><span class="indent">The hall was roughly the same size as a university auditorium, and the ground was marked with railways, making it impossible for people to stand around.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1037"><span class="italic indent">There’s models of mountains, valleys and tunnels here were…made for aerodynamic analysis?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1038"><span class="indent">“Indeed. As expected from Young Master to have seen through their purposes right away. Honestly, the impressive thing here is all of the talented researchers that have gathered in our nation. They managed to build such an amazing facility with ease.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1039"><span class="indent">Indeed, Kaijin had a point.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1040"><span class="indent">It was thanks to the engineers’ collaboration that this groundbreaking facility had been created.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1041"><span class="indent">This three-dimensional model was created using magic. Kaijin made the masterpiece of a prototype train, currently running along on the track, and it was one of his best works yet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1042"><span class="indent">“What’s powering this train?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1043"><span class="indent">I could have deciphered it using Raphael-sensei’s ‘<span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’, but I asked about it on purpose.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1044"><span class="indent">“Steam,” Kaijin replied with a grin.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1045"><span class="indent">I nodded in response. It was just as I thought.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1046"><span class="indent">Right now, horses provided the physical power for trains operating within our nation. These horses would pull the carriages as they slid along the track. Naturally, the total load capacity was about the same as horse-drawn carriages. Although it improved stability and helped reduce traffic, overall efficiency hadn’t improved a significant amount.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1047"><span class="indent">There had been proposals for either golems or <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to drag trains around, but these proposals ultimately could not solve the root of the problem.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1048"><span class="indent">The key was to develop a locomotive.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1049"><span class="indent">And its primary source of power was the steam engine.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1050"><span class="indent">Of course, it wouldn’t use old world technology like burning coal. Rather, we tried to create an engine that utilized both the strengths of magic and science.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1051"><span class="indent">This was why we named it the ‘Magic Train’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1052"><span class="indent">The concept behind the magic engine was using magic to convert magicules into an energy source, which then provided the combustion energy that gave rise to steam—this was the basic magical mechanism. Perhaps this prototype could be called the ‘Spirit Magic Core’. Even though it was a simple design, it still required sophisticated magical technology.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1053"><span class="indent">The laws that magic obeyed were drastically different than those that governed the natural world. It was difficult trying to observe any patterns from the former, due to its ability to grant effects purely by imagination.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1054"><span class="indent">For instance, let’s say there was a lit candle inside a transparent glass container. The enclosed space would quickly consume oxygen and produce a high concentration of carbon dioxide. However, if the fire was made by magic, it would continue to burn regardless. As long as the mage’s mana and the necessary magicules were still there, the magical fire wouldn’t disappear. Naturally, the mage’s mana had a finite limit, so the fire couldn’t burn forever.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1055"><span class="indent">Through this experiment, we could see that magical flame was governed by laws different from that of the chemical reaction behind combustion. Therefore, even if you tried to apply the same phenomenon for another purpose, the reality was that it wouldn’t work. Consequently, hardly anyone correlated magic to the laws of physics in this world.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1056"><span class="indent">With that being said, the magic here purely referred to elemental magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1057"><span class="indent">Spirit magic, which could be cast by borrowing the power of spirits, would not be manipulated by a mage’s imagination. In other words, it was a magic that delivered the power of a spirit—a being whose existence was based on natural phenomena—in its original, purest form.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1058"><span class="indent">This meant that the fire caused by spirit magic would consume oxygen and generate carbon dioxide.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1059"><span class="indent">By the way, during my battle with Ifrit in the past, ‘Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ had warned me about causing a steam explosion. The reason why it could have potentially worked was because Ifrit’s flames obeyed the same properties as fire in the natural world. Had it been elemental magic, which alters the laws of physics using magicules, my strategy undoubtedly wouldn’t have worked.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1060"><span class="indent">This was the same reason why I could use spirit magic while inside the ‘Holy Purification Barrier’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1061"><span class="indent">There was one more thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1062"><span class="indent">In order to illuminate the cave inside, I once used ‘Engraving Magic’ to heat up metal, yet the light generated proved insufficient. Thus, I had Dold work on it and he changed it to another spell. Apparently, he devised a method of directly converting magicules into light by applying elemental magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1063"><span class="indent">Thanks to magic, there were some processes that could be completely bypassed for results. Yet, the downside was that there wasn’t much interest behind analyzing the natural phenomenon in this world.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1064"><span class="indent">In order to recreate the technology of physical phenomenon, it would be better to utilize spirit magic, which also relied on the same type of physical phenomenon. And that was how I came up with the idea of incorporating spirits as the power source for the magic engine.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1065"><span class="indent">Kaijin was very impressed. “Sometimes, we would boil water with the excess heat from the fire at the smithery, but we never knew we could use steam this way.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1066"><span class="indent">I was more shocked at their technological capabilities as they were able to recreate steam engines solely from my explanations.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1067"><span class="indent">“All in all, there are a lot of methods to power it. For instance, using pistons, turbines and steam—basically, it’s using thermal energy to do either mechanical work or converting it into electricity. That will be our field of research in the future. It appears that the research in the piston mechanism is going rather smoothly,” I commented.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1068"><span class="indent">“Ah, you’re right, Young Master. If we can figure out how to work with electricity, then we can produce a great deal of power,” agreed Kaijin, turning to the small train.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1069"><span class="indent">I have had discussions regarding electricity with Kaijin and the others before. They seemed to have done plenty of research since then, and now possessed some level of understanding.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1070"><span class="indent">I was starting to think that they knew more about it than I did.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1071"><span class="indent">Kaijin was gazing at the locomotive that had six trains attached to it. Each one was carrying some iron ingots.

And so, I assigned it to them, and they immediately developed a low quality paper prototype made out of wood fibers. After that, they were on their own, but through a lot of trial and error, the paper quality quickly reached a good standard. Even though they did have physical samples, as well the necessary information about the steps to produce paper, this was still very impressive work.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1079"><span class="indent">I immediately praised them afterward.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1080"><span class="indent">Back to the topic of the important notes I was given.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1081"><span class="indent">There were a lot of questions, proposed solutions, experiments and their subsequent outcomes. It was all very intriguing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1082"><span class="indent">There were passages regarding motive power, and the required amount of magicules for generating it; a record of how long the engine managed to run and the accompanying deterioration; the estimated load capacity and the load conditions on the cargo bed. This allowed us to calculate the stability of the interior train, and even the extent of the train’s acceleration.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1083"><span class="indent">All of this data could be used as reference when we eventually built a full-scale locomotive. I hurriedly sped through everything, and it seemed that all the relevant theories had been completed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1084"><span class="indent">Given the aforementioned information, we could actually start crafting a prototype—eh, could it be?!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1085"><span class="indent">“Oi, Veldora, when you mentioned ‘prototype’, could it be that you weren’t referring to the model train, but something else?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1086"><span class="indent">“Kukuku, how impressive.

Turns out summoning a fire spirit in the engine alone was not enough. We needed to control the power output and had to have actual workers stationed nearby. Therefore, each locomotive would need to be staffed with a qualified mage. We could start to train mages based on the number of trains planned for manufacture, but it would take too much time. That’s why we decided to build and install magic circuits in the train to automatically regulate it. The fire spirit, which is the engine’s ‘Core’, and the control panel engraved with ‘Engraving Magic’ that controls it; everything came together to give you the finished product.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1092"><span class="indent">He offhandedly mentioned about summoning spirits, but the process proved to be a major hindrance. Because lower spirits lacked enough power, mid-tier spirits, such as fire salamanders, had to be summoned at the very least.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1093"><span class="indent">A salamander’s power could reach up to Rank B+, which was impossible for any average person to summon.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1094"><span class="italic indent">Is it because Ramiris is here after all?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1095"><span class="indent">It likely had to do with the fact that she used to be the Queen of Spirits.

I then handed the consolidated book to Vesta, assured that he was going to put them to good use.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1115"><span class="indent">It felt like the secondary use of it through magic, but it was very convenient.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1116"><span class="indent">“Indeed, that’s how it is.

Didn’t you too, Vesta?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1123"><span class="indent">“Of course. When <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama handed the research regarding the application of electricity to us, Kaijin-dono and I studied the materials in detail. Even though there are still parts that I don’t understand, with all these researchers under one roof, we were able to utilize everyone’s wisdom.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1124"><span class="indent">“Well, that’s right. Everyone helped answer our questions and doubts. And, when I saw the guardian golem of that little girl there—Ramiris-sama—I was truly surprised. A working product of our abandoned ‘Armored Soldier Project’, right in front of me,” Kaijin recalled.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1125"><span class="indent">Indeed, that was the case.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1126"><span class="indent">If you had the real thing right in front of you, obviously you would get a better understanding of how it worked.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1127"><span class="indent">Right now, another guardian golem was being built and was supposed to become a subject of research.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1128"><span class="indent">“Exactly. As I read that book and heeded varying opinions, I realized that we had a serious misinterpretation. Back then, we experimented under the belief that elemental magic and spirit magic were the same kind of magic. That was the source of our mistakes—”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1129"><span class="indent">“—So then, we deduced what we were lacking by investigating with the guardian golem in front of us.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1130"><span class="indent">What became clear with those results was that the law of magic completely changed depending on the magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1131"><span class="indent">As for Ramiris’s guardian golem, instead of spirit magic, the summoned spirit itself was being used. Because Kaijin and the researchers tried to move the ‘Spirit Magic Core’ with elemental magic, they failed to initiate a chain reaction and thus wasn’t operating properly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1132"><span class="indent">“—And yet, I ended up increasing the magic output. The result, the magic heat had nowhere to go, eventually grew out of control, and the experiment ended in a failure.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1133"><span class="indent">I see, it was that kind of thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1134"><span class="indent">In Ramiris’s case, there was a possibility that she simply couldn’t use elemental magic, and thus her golem reflected that. But, as a result, that became the key to success. The guardian golem’s power reactor was the ‘Spirit Magic Core’, but as engineers gathered en mass, they seemed to have found a way to fully realize its performance capabilities. And by analyzing my ‘Master Core’, the original ‘Spirit Magic Core’ was completed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1135"><span class="indent">“I feel both happy and frustrated.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1136"><span class="indent">“Yes, I wholly agree. To think that the theory we once gave up on was only due to a misunderstanding…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1137"><span class="indent">Despite how much research they conducted, they couldn’t even see any signs of success with just the theory, but as soon as they clarified and fixed their mistake, they were able to finish and obtain results right away. It was so ridiculous, Kaijin and his team couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1138"><span class="indent">“What? If we have the ‘Spirit Magic Core’, we could convert magicules into energy. Well, there are different types of energy, so it’s kind of hard to explain.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1139"><span class="indent">“This locomotive is converting magicules into heat in order to turn the turbines. Thus, we can also generate the electricity that <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama mentioned before, and illuminate each car like this, too.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1140"><span class="indent">I was surprised.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1141"><span class="indent">No, I was genuinely surprised.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1142"><span class="indent">In other words, this train was powered by a fully completed ‘Spirit Magic Core’. By giving magicules to spirits of various attributes, they would then convert the magicules into a more easily usable energy. Furthermore, they had the ability to circulate energy as well. They could send electricity made by the turbines to the ‘Spirit Magic Core’ and store it safely. Although the spirits were capable of directly generating electricity, Vesta and the others said that the method would be too difficult to control. Therefore, they decided to use the electricity generated in the steam engine instead.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1143"><span class="indent">After all, electricity wasn’t that great if it was high voltage. Not only did we need power plants, but also substations and a battery storage facility to actually hold the charge.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1144"><span class="indent">To think all that such a complicated process was handled solely by the ‘Spirit Magic Core’…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1145"><span class="indent">Moreover, with magicules already in the atmosphere, fuel wasn’t that big of a concern. If the concentration wasn’t high enough, all you needed to do was prepare magic stones, which were simple enough to carry around.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1146"><span class="indent">The continuous operating time was determined by the presence or absence of magicules.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1147"><span class="indent">If the locomotive was a place where magicules were always present, and as long as it doesn’t do anything strenuous, it technically could—maintenance definitely required—operate forever.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1148"><span class="indent">It was like a dream come true.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1149"><span class="indent">“Come on, <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, aren’t you surprised?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1150"><span class="indent">“We’re like this when we get serious!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1151"><span class="indent">Although it irritated me seeing Veldora and Ramiris brag like that, what they had achieved was admittedly astonishing.

Only after these plans were complete could the railways be laid down. We must be mentally prepared for long-term construction efforts.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1204"><span class="indent">Furthermore, I really wanted to lead the route to the coastline soon so we could provide sea products at a cheap price. We also planned to establish a main railway line between the kingdom of Blumund and <span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1205"><span class="indent">Now that I was considering all of these new connections, it would take some time before the whole traffic network could be considered fully operational.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1206"><span class="indent">We also couldn’t forget about the development of the trains. Since the prototype had been completed, we had jumped across the biggest hurdle. Now, all we had to do was to put the prototype through the wringer. Although we had already established our fantastic motor core, the rest of the ‘Magic Train’ still required further development.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1207"><span class="indent">It was important to ensure the trains were comfortable to ride. We also had to tackle the issue of noise that the trains would undoubtedly unleash upon its surroundings. Our train was already substantially quieter than traditional steam locomotives. However, traveling at such high speeds still generated a bothersome racket.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1208"><span class="indent">The research team headed by Kaijin was currently working to address such concerns. We were breaking down these troubling problems to smaller, bite-sized pieces to tackle them in finer detail and find theoretical solutions. Meanwhile, I also hoped that they kept a record of the processes they took to resolve these issues. It was my wish that this journal would eventually become useful reference material for future research prospects.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1209"><span class="indent">With that being said, since we had managed to develop the most challenging component, the ‘Spirit Magic Core’, it was fine to hand all train-related matters to Kaijin.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1210"><span class="indent">For other recently initiated research projects, we spared no expense in their financing from the national treasury. I had to appeal to <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> so he could allocate more funds.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1211"><span class="indent">And so, I started to visit the research facility frequently. I even got quite familiar with the researchers and had plenty of opportunities to discuss useful ideas. The knowledge I possessed as an ‘Otherworlder’ was all too intriguing to them. They often stopped to consult my opinions.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1212"><span class="indent">Although, when they posed a question that I couldn’t answer, I had <span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Raphael-san handle it. By entrusting my problems to Raphael-sensei, whose ability rivaled that of a quantum computer, no matter how difficult the questions were, it could solve them with ease. And I have been putting it to use relentlessly as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1213"><span class="indent">After finishing the day’s work, it was also important to squeeze in some time for socializing at night. While not all the night shops were luxurious, they were still one of the go-to spots for researchers to take a breather from work. There, they could relax and engage in casual conversation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1214"><span class="indent">I, for one, was no exception.

Surely you guys understand what I mean.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1217"><span class="indent">In addition, among Veldora, Ramiris, and myself, Ramiris was the one getting paid the most. Her salary was still very promising even after deducting the costs of running the labyrinth. She was compensated with twenty percent of the labyrinth revenues. It was no longer just the two gold coins we had estimated at the start. Nowadays, she could earn up to twenty gold coins or more.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1218"><span class="indent">Twenty gold coins were about two million Japanese yen per day. However, Ramiris was also responsible for paying the salaries of <span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and her sisters, as well as Beretta. That said, she was still projected to profit nearly one hundred gold coins by the end of the month.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1219"><span class="indent">My daily allowance was the same as Veldora’s: one gold coin a day from the national treasury.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1220"><span class="indent">Veldora was the labyrinth master, so Ramiris also rewarded him with extra pocket money. Since the labyrinth greatly depended on Veldora’s magicules, the treasury granted him special bonuses as well. That’s why he actually got paid more than I did.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1221"><span class="indent">In spite of this, I did keep some pocket change around. I had been investing in many varying fields and the profits were incredibly favorable.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1222"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1223"><span class="indent">Motivated by everyone’s enthusiasm for work, I also decided to work hard.

The most vital component, its heart core, was already completed. In addition, I had also completed the outline and general sketch of the body. We did have a guardian golem available for reference though. We could always refer to that during research. However, the actual construction would require time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1229"><span class="indent">Moreover, Kaijin was busy with the ‘Magic Train’ while Vesta was focused on developing the ‘Magic Armor Soldier’ by himself. If Vesta were available, he’d come to assist Ramiris. However, it would certainly be awfully tiring for him.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1230"><span class="indent">We would be incorporating the completed ‘Spirit Magic Core’, so I also wanted to collect empirical data, and in order to achieve that, the more help we could get, the better.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1231"><span class="indent">“By the way, what has Veldora been up to?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1232"><span class="indent">“Hmm—I don’t know what Mentor has been up to.

That’s why instead of letting him labor as Ramiris’s assistant, I might as well cut him some slack and let him do as he pleases.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1236"><span class="indent">“I get it.

On one hand, he wanted to resume with his own work, but on the other hand, he was overjoyed to participate in my project. As a researcher, Vesta’s interests seemed to be torn between the two. Just the fact that he had these inner turmoils was a testament to how far he had come along. Even now, he demonstrated an example of his maturity.

There have been so many astonishing discoveries every day, to the point that I forgo sleep just so I wouldn’t miss out!” he informed me without even trying to contain his excitement.

It was almost hard to believe; a complete one-eighty from what I’d expected.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1462"><span class="indent">For my original plan, only the skeletons of the one thousand bodies would be crafted out of magisteel, and then they would be submerged in the magicule medium. Theoretically speaking, the skeleton would be used as the foundation to form a bone golem.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1463"><span class="indent">Since the framework was artificial, there was little possibility of their bodies decaying. There wouldn’t be any soul possessing the bodies, either. Only the magicules in the liquid would crystalize on the skeletons. The probability that the bodies would abruptly gain self-consciousness was theoretically zero.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1464"><span class="indent">Unlike when I had created Beretta, they did not require detailed modelling.

However, various measures were taken to implement each essential body part. The most eye-catching one was the central component. Inside their chest was the artificial representation for the heart, the pumping ‘Spirit Magic Core’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1467"><span class="indent">“This is…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1468"><span class="indent">“I came up with the idea! If they have a strong enough core, the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would probably be even stronger,” Ramiris casually revealed with a smirk.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1469"><span class="indent">In layman’s terms, it was already very difficult to prepare one thousand ‘Spirit Magic Cores’. It wouldn’t take me too long to craft them, but with a lack of interest and passion, I considered it a chore and didn’t have the motivation to make them. That was why I wanted to resort to something simpler. Yet, Ramiris was apparently too stubborn to compromise. Looks like she did the work the traditional way to prepare the portions for one thousand bodies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1470"><span class="indent">They even had ‘Emulated Souls’ installed. It seemed that the technology to possess a homunculus from <span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also being utilized here.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1471"><span class="indent">Although Beretta easily possessed his body, if it were <span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s sisters, they presumably would struggle to achieve the same result. With that being said, using ‘Emulated Souls’ was probably the right choice.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1472"><span class="indent">On the downside, this would obviously have led to a ton of work… No wonder why she complained about the lack of manpower.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1473"><span class="indent">“Ramiris-sama’s ideas were wonderful and truly intriguing.

With the sheer amount of stuff here, he could have gotten as much data as he wanted.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1475"><span class="indent">These fist-sized ‘Spirit Magic Cores’ were all top-quality products. When combined with the skeletons I had built, the alteration greatly differed from my original design. There were even enchantments on the metallic bones. As magicules enveloped the skeleton, they began materializing as muscle tissue. We could further observe the process of how <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were born.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1476"><span class="indent">I finally understood why Vesta considered sleeping a waste of valuable time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1477"><span class="indent">“How about it?

Well, how about it? What do you think?!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1482"><span class="indent">Apart from shouting her line, Ramiris also proudly puffed out her chest.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1483"><span class="italic indent">Mhm, you can show off all you want this time. This is truly extraordinary stuff.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1484"><span class="indent">While Ramiris looked a bit ditzy at first glance, she was still intelligent. She was highly knowledgeable about spirit engineering to the point of mastery, and right now she was also learning about magic science. I heard that she’d been visiting level ninety-five quite frequently.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1485"><span class="indent">She didn’t just idle around during her immense, cyclic lifespan. Her proficiency in the laws of physics was exceptional. Surprisingly enough, she was fully qualified as a researcher.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1486"><span class="italic indent">I can’t allow her appearance to deceive me</span><span class="indent">.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1487"><span class="indent">“Ahh, these are really impressive. And they’re all hand-crafted as well. How much work did you put in making this?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1488"><span class="indent">“It was super tiring. Although they aren’t dolls with ball joints like Beretta, but rather simply bodies imitating human skeletons, if we prepare heart-emulating cores like this, I’m sure that they will absorb a large quantity of magicules when submerged in the capsule.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1489"><span class="indent">I wholeheartedly agreed with a nod after listening to Ramiris’s opinion.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1490"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1491"><span class="indent">Thus, we now had the ability to manufacture bodies that were far stronger than I had predicted. They would be the cream of the crop.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1492"><span class="indent">Gazing at the vessels that were suspended in the capsules, I tried to estimate their potential strength. I suspected their magicule content would be at the top of Rank A—and there were a thousand of them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1493"><span class="indent">This was all thanks to the integration of ‘Spirit Magic Cores’ and ‘Emulated Souls’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1494"><span class="italic indent">What an incredible feat.</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;I was thoroughly impressed from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1495"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

In order to complete the bodies early, I headed to the research facility today as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1499"><span class="indent">The place was bustling with activity; Ramiris was in a heated argument with Veldora.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1500"><span class="indent">“Like I said, I want to pour mentor’s magicules directly into the capsules to accelerate the growth!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1501"><span class="indent">“But what would happen if you messed it up?

Moreover, I will also show support for that thing mentor wants to request from <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So pleeeese, pretty please!” Ramiris beseeched Veldora to donate some of his magicules.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1505"><span class="italic indent">They sure are close.</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;I couldn’t help but smile at the scene.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1506"><span class="indent">By the way, what was it that Veldora wanted to request from me?

Veldora nodded with an ‘Mhm’. Despite acting all pompous, his expression clearly gave away the fact that he was more than happy to do it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1510"><span class="indent">On one hand, it was probably because of Ramiris’s instigation, while on the other hand, he likely would have agreed regardless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1511"><span class="indent">Veldora raised his hand toward a capsule and bellowed, “HYAA!” It was quite the spectacle as he injected his magicules. The abnormally dense magicules began to swirl inside the capsule.

Even if the cylinder broke, we could still revise our course of action. Compared to that, I was more curious about what Ramiris intended to accomplish.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1514"><span class="indent">Within the capsule, magicules crystallized and adhered to the magisteel skeleton, like moths to a flame, forming artificial tissue. Everything followed Raphael-sensei’s plan to a T.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1515"><span class="indent">But with Veldora dumping a massive quantity of magicules, unexpected side effects were bound to arise. A large amount was absorbed by the skeleton and consequently caused structural modifications.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1516"><span class="indent">“How strange? It seems different from what I expected…” Ramiris said, perplexed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1517"><span class="indent">Well, that was usually how scientific experiments went.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1518"><span class="indent">The material that made up the skeleton could no longer be classified as magisteel. We didn’t mix any rare elements like gold or silver in, so it was neither orichalcum nor mithril. However, in terms of yield and tensile strength, while it was not as strong as the ultimate metal, Hihiirokane</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;ヒヒイロカネ, the author is referencing a Japanese mythical metal that is said to be harder than diamond." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">, it was strong enough to rival orichalcum.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1519"><span class="indent">But what bothered me the most was that despite being a type of metal, it almost looked alive…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1520"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Answer.

The dryads could move freely around the labyrinth without a body, whereas the treants couldn’t. Although treants retained the ability to reposition near where they were rooted, they couldn’t possibly leave the forest and enter areas without soil. Essentially, without a body, their mana would steadily dissipate over time, which was detrimental to their well-being.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1556"><span class="indent">The same concept applied to the dryads, where if they were too far away from their corpus, then their strength would greatly diminish as well.

Muscles and blood vessels started growing on the silver black skeleton. Skin quickly formed the final layer, and just like Veldora, it had a tanned hue. Its head was veiled with wavy long hair, whose black color gave off an impressive sheen. There were highlights of red intertwined, like a burning flame was scattered within. It had golden eyes, while its dragon-like pupils glowed a deep scarlet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1649"><span class="indent">Eh, no matter how you looked at it, that figure was a female. And a superb beauty as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1650"><span class="indent">“Oh oh, Ifrit, how does it feel to return to the mortal realm with a body?” commented Veldora.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1651"><span class="indent">Ah, so this femme fatale was undeniably Ifrit. Putting aside whether spirits really possessed genders, I explicitly remembered that it had a more </span><span class="italic indent">masculine</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;body type.

And <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I am eternally grateful for you resurrecting me.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1653"><span class="indent">Despite my confusion, Ifrit kneeled as soon as she finished speaking. I was afraid that Ifrit would rebel out of her loyalty for Leon, but it seemed that I had worried for nothing. Immense relief flooded through me.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1654"><span class="indent">“Oh, oh oh, I’m glad you look well.

However, what I was most curious about—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1657"><span class="indent">“I recall that your previous look was more suited for combat, I mean, you looked a lot more agile moving around…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1658"><span class="italic indent">And you didn’t have gigantic breasts like those, right?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1659"><span class="indent">—I didn’t dare say the last line out loud. I didn’t have the audacity.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1660"><span class="indent">You couldn’t exactly blame me for thinking this way. Ifrit only had a few thin articles of clothing that covered her private areas. She was aiming for a super-hot belly dancer outfit. Her elbows, belly, thighs were all exposed, which came off as really erotic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1661"><span class="indent">“Are you referring to this look…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1662"><span class="indent">Upon saying so, Ifrit suddenly sighed for some reason.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1663"><span class="indent">“I am afraid this was Veldora-sama’s fau—I mean his will.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1664"><span class="indent">She wanted to say, ‘It was Veldora’s fault,’ didn’t she?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1665"><span class="indent">Ifrit seemed a bit worn out, and I got the impression that she was wholly exasperated. Could it be that she’s been suffering the whole time in my ‘Stomach’? Now that I thought about it, Ifrit had been alone with Veldora for approximately two years with no means of escape. I was pretty sure she had a rough time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1666"><span class="indent">“Hmph! It was thanks to me that you got a body. Do remember to be grateful!” Veldora reproached.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1667"><span class="indent">“—Understood.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1668"><span class="indent">Ifrit’s reply sounded rather forced.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1669"><span class="indent">“You said it was the will of Veldora. What did you mean by that?” I inquired, wanting clarification.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1670"><span class="indent">“Hmm?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1671"><span class="indent">“Oh, about that. Even though I am a greater fire elemental spirit, now I can somehow wield wind elemental power as well. My hair should have been red, yet for some reason its color is mostly dark. I believe that Veldora-sama’s power has influenced it greatly. Furthermore, it may have been because the Charybdis was a female that I ended up looking like this.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1672"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Report. Correct.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1673"><span class="italic indent">She got it right?! Oi oi, can you really change something like gender this casually?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1674"><span class="indent">I didn’t mean to offend her, so hopefully she wouldn’t hate me for it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1675"><span class="indent">“W-well, if you are not satisfied with it—”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1676"><span class="indent">“How could I be unsatisfied. Putting aside my appearance, I have become far stronger than I had ever been before,” Ifrit declared while cracking a brilliant smile.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1677"><span class="indent">Veldora had probably teased her so much to the point where she had grown accustomed to it. She seemed to be tremendously adaptable. It also made her quite affable. Unlike when she was fused with Shizu-san, I couldn’t sense any malicious intent from Ifrit anymore.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1678"><span class="indent">“Do you not hate me?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1679"><span class="indent">“No, how could I hate you?

Thinking back, the sense of duty and responsibility Shizue Izawa and I both shared was very strong. However, our ideologies were diametrically opposed, and so we weren’t able to build any other connections.

Though I did have to occasionally act as if I was trying my best, lest I be viewed as a slacker. This was what we called adults’ art of socializing. It was never a good idea to invest maximum effort at work. If you were to do that, then the amount of work you did would be viewed as the norm.

Many adventurers and migrant laborers, family in tow, had immigrated to our town. Naturally, there were many children among them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2191"><span class="indent">In this world, it was the norm for children of low-income families to be part of the labor force. However, our nation had laws prohibiting child labor. After all, a kid’s job was just to have fun and enjoy their childhood. Anyway, they only needed to study things they were interested in.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2192"><span class="indent">Both humans and <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be subject to the same standards of education.

That was the objective.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2193"><span class="indent">By the way, the students in this school weren’t limited to just children. Adults would come here to learn writing and mathematics, too. Mastering these subjects was essential, so they were eminently enthusiastic to develop their skills. The lack of these skills would no doubt close many doors for them. They may also make simple mistakes that could trouble their coworkers. Since the adults were all evidently aware of this, they had been studying hard.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2194"><span class="indent">Not knowing whether or not anything you learned would be applicable to the real world was probably one of the biggest reasons why people were never motivated to study. However, that wasn’t a problem here. Furthermore, the hard work of the adults would inspire the children to put in similar effort towards their studies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2195"><span class="indent">With that being said, putting aside mathematics, the focus was mainly on reading and writing. To be honest, even I considered the curriculum difficult, and <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was of the same mind.

Without that, even I didn’t have the confidence to score full marks on a language exam administered here. I figured that as long as it didn’t cause any problems, I could simply play dumb about it. Although, this </span><span class="italic indent">did</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;feel like cheating.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2197"><span class="indent">Getting back on topic, the children were excelling in their studies. Serving as a wonderful incentive to boost their eagerness for learning, I had translated manga into this world’s language. It was a huge success. It seemed like everyone in the school was a fan of the manga, to the point where some even carried it around with them, apparently turning it into a highly coveted status symbol.

Furthermore, it was accompanied by a shockwave which closed in on Laplace, who was fleeing further away.

Yer twins? Then ya can stop fighting already, ya won’t be able to beat me!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4033"><span class="indent">Laplace was so unconcerned that he could run around dodging attacks, and still have the strength to crack jokes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4034"><span class="indent">Louis remained emotionless to Laplace’s teasing. He didn’t mind that his attacks were being avoided; he simply continued to swing his hands at Laplace.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4035"><span class="indent">At some point, the two ended up fighting outside of the tomb. With Laplace constantly avoiding Louis’s attack, it was only natural that they would wind up here.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4036"><span class="indent">“As you just said, I am Louis’s twin. Our power was quite alike to each other, so was our appearance. The only difference was that Roy was more aggressive while I didn’t have much emotion, that is all the difference. However, there was one aspect that I am a lot stronger than him in, that is, I have good eyes.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4037"><span class="indent">“The hell is ‘good eyes’?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4038"><span class="indent">“I can closely analyze my opponent’s skill, body language and his focus of attack. That is why I clearly see that you have been looking for an opening on me ever since we started.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4039"><span class="indent">“…The hell, so ya really are better than yer bro. But having a good pair of eyes alone ain’t gonna beat me!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4040"><span class="indent">“Don’t sound so certain. By the way, my name is Louis; please do not call me his </span><span class="italic indent">bro</span><span class="indent">. To be honest, I was not that close to Roy.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4041"><span class="indent">“Hmph—fine. It’s none of my business anyway.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4042"><span class="indent">Amidst the fierce combat—or rather, Laplace evading Louis’s pressing attacks and casually responding—it was not Louis who was observing him; instead, Laplace was the one analyzing Louis. It was evident from the expression of his eyes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4043"><span class="indent">“Enough of this, aren’t you getting tired? Take a good nap for now,” Louis declared.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4044"><span class="indent">His attacks began to intensify.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4045"><span class="indent">“Told ya it’s useless.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4046"><span class="indent">“Is that so? Then allow me to go even further.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4047"><span class="indent">His tone did not change at all, yet Laplace had a bad feeling about this. His instincts were surprisingly accurate in times like these. He instantly darted away from the scene with overly theatrical movements.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4048"><span class="indent">His judgement was on the mark.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4049"><span class="indent">Louis’s attack split apart and decimated the location where Laplace was standing just a moment ago.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4050"><span class="indent">“—Uh! What is this power…?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4051"><span class="indent">The latest attack held immense destructive potential. Had Laplace continued to underestimate Louis, he likely would not have been able to react quick enough, sustaining severe injuries as a result.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4052"><span class="indent">“Phew—I’m finally getting the hang of this. I’m surprised you managed to dodge that strike. Looks like you are not a simple man after all.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4053"><span class="indent">“Ya wanted me to get careless so ya could take me out with that shot, right?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4054"><span class="indent">“Well, I can’t say I didn’t. But I can still beat you without underhanded tricks like that.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4055"><span class="indent">“What are ya on about?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4056"><span class="indent">Laplace had slaughtered Roy. At the time, Roy had underestimated Laplace, but even if he hadn’t, Laplace’s strength was still far greater than that of Roy’s.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4057"><span class="indent">Regardless, Laplace did not get careless. Even when Roy acted as the body-double of <span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Ruminas, his power still rivalled Kazaream’s. That was the undeniable truth. Kazaream was like a parent to Laplace and the clowns, and there was no way Laplace would let his guard down against someone of his caliber.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4058"><span class="indent">“Just now, that was the enhanced version of ‘Blood <span data-term="Rain" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’. Its magic aura was purposely hidden to lower my opponent’s guard. Although, once they’ve seen it in action, it is impossible to pull it off again.” Louis decided to explain his skill to Laplace, even though he was essentially showing his hand.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4059"><span class="indent">Yet hearing this worsened the ominous feeling in Laplace’s heart.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4060"><span class="italic indent">This is bad. Is he stalling? The hell is this guy’s goal?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4061"><span class="indent">Laplace’s instinct told him that he was still in danger. He determined that he would fall into Louis’s trap at this rate, and decided to pull out his trump card immediately. There was no time for hesitation. A moment of indecision could cost him his life.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4062"><span class="indent">“—And that is why you will die here!” Louis roared as Laplace’s surroundings exploded.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4063"><span class="indent">The shockwaves from the explosion were concentrated at the center region where Laplace was standing. He had nowhere to run, since the ‘Blood Ray’ missiles had already locked onto him.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4064"><span class="indent">The victor had been decided.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4065"><span class="indent">Anyone would reach the same conclusion if they saw it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4066"><span class="indent">The flames burnt fiercely.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4067"><span class="indent">A humanoid figure collapsed at the center.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4068"><span class="indent">“What a pity. Roy and I were the same person; it was <span data-term="Ruminas" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s power that separated us into two.
