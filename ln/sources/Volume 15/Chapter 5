# Chapter 5: The Truth of|the Emperor

Damrada was alone thinking to himself while guarding one of the eight gates.

Why had this happened to him?

.........

......

...

The current situation was dire.

Yuuki had fallen into Emperor Rudra's hands, and like his companions, was deprived of his free will. Having been ordered by Rudra to take care of him, Damrada could not resist. And now, Rudra had given him another order. After handing over the care of Yuuki to someone else, he was to board the Emperor's flagship.

And so began the great battle in the air.

The true identity of the Marshal as Velgrynd was told up to the sixth rank, but it could not be told to anyone. This was an absolute order, and for Damrada, who was often away from home, it was such an important secret that his memory was even manipulated.

*That's right. I made a promise to that man. And that was---*

Seeing the Marshal turn into Velgrynd reminded Damrada of that. At the same time, many memories were clearly coming back to him. He remembered his most important promise to Rudra, but he also remembered the reason why he had to do it.

*Well then, what should I do...?*

There was no time to worry about it.

The Demon Lord Rimuru he had seen a while ago seemed so benevolent that he didn't feel like much of a threat. As long as he was trapped in the strange space created by Velgrynd, he should not be able to interfere with the mission to capture Veldora.

Indeed, Veldora's domination was complete. This gave Rudra an advantage over Guy---But to Damrada, none of that mattered.

Not only that, but for Rudra as well...

With a clarity of thought that seemed to clear his foggy mind, Damrada wondered what was best for Rudra. However, before he could answer that question, Demon Lord Rimuru made his move. It was a fury of unprecedented proportions. Damrada was tempted to question himself as to why he had not thought of him as a threat. The mere fact that he had escaped Velgrynd's realm showed just how dangerous he was.

But there was more to it than that.

From the moment he saw Rimuru appear, Damrada realized that he had been too naïve in his opinion. Rimuru had glanced at Damrada and the others with those glittering golden eyes. It was an unmistakably cold look, almost as if he did not even recognize Damrada and the others as enemies.

Kondou had responded immediately, but his attack was ineffective.

![break]

<---Is that all? In that case, there's no need to be wary. I will deal with you later. You can be afraid all you want. Try not to get killed until I deal with you.--->

![break]

Rimuru's eyes seemed to be telling him.

To Rimuru, Damrada and the others were already dead, weren't they? Emperor Rudra was no exception, and Damrada felt that if things continued as they were, they would all be killed together.

What were the conditions for Rimuru's tactical victory in this situation?

There were two conditions that needed to be met:

- ?[label](1.) Reclaiming Veldora.

- ?[label](2.) Eliminating the invaders.

Veldora was an ally of Demon Lord Rimuru. To deprive Veldora of his free will would be unacceptable to Rimuru. The fact that he had come here meant that he was prepared to deal with Velgrynd. From Damrada's point of view, there was no telling how the battle would turn out. It was an unattainable pinnacle of a match-up, and it was not something that Damrada could predict.

As for the elimination of the invaders...

Rimuru was said to be a pacifist, but one should not mistake that for non-resistance. There had been many acts of aggression towards them in the past, but they had all been repelled. They were not afraid of the means. With the help of Veldora, the monster nation had won many battles in a row.

Rimuru would never forgive the Empire's aggression. The time for negotiations was over, and it was conceivable that the best course of action for him would be to kill all the Imperial soldiers. In that case, bargaining would be meaningless, and they would have to fight to the end. There was no guarantee that they would be forgiven even if they surrendered under the condition that neither side had any wartime agreements.

It was the Imperial side that had set a trap for Rimuru, who came to negotiate with them because he did not want to fight. They had lost all credibility and would not be trusted by Rimuru. The negotiation windows were closed.

*I should have been more serious about stopping His Majesty.*

Damrada was also proud of the Empire's strength. He had been overconfident in the Empire's power, thinking that it could not be defeated and that they could set the victory conditions as they pleased.

Show the enemy the majesty of the empire, defeat the enemy thoroughly, make them lose the will to rebel before swallowing them up. They could change the leadership, replace them with puppets, and do whatever they wanted as long as they won the war.---This was how the Empire had been able to expand its territory, but this time they had made a huge miscalculation. In addition to the fact that they were clashing with evenly matched forces, there was no guarantee that even Emperor Rudra would be safe.

It was no wonder that Damrada was in a depressed mood.

![break]

All that said, Damrada's real concern was about the promise made between himself and Rudra.

There was no doubt that Rimuru intended to kill Rudra. This made Damrada confused about how he should act. Damrada also wished to keep his promise to Rudra, but he wanted to accomplish it with his own hands However, it seemed difficult to win with Rimuru as an opponent...

Damrada shuddered, analyzing the situation. The flagship had been enveloped in a terrible spell, and the survivors were now defending the eight gates.

Could this really be called an even match?

To Damrada, it seemed as if they had made a terrible mistake.

.........

......

...

And then came to now.

"Did I keep you waiting?"

Before Damrada's eyes was a girl smiling happily. This girl was one of the strongest in the world, a pillar of the seven primordial demons. Her 'name' was Ultima, a subordinate under the control of Demon Lord Rimuru.

"Not only to add the primordials to his ranks, but to give them power..."

It was even more terrifying when one saw it up close.

As soon as the fearsome 'Death Streak' was shown to be inordinately accurate and powerful, the demons' evolution was assured.

Rimuru had opened a tremendously huge Demon Summoning Gate (Summon Gate) without regard to the fact that he was being watched. There was a hint that the subordinates he had summoned were up to something.

He didn't have time to investigate it, but Ultima had given him the answer. Enjoying herself, Ultima let out a laugh.

"Ahahahahaha, you noticed that? That's right, Rimuru-sama gave me the power, and now I'm in great shape!"

In contrast to Ultima, who was very happy, Damrada's was in a nightmare.

Giving power to a 'primordial'---After all, it was not something that a mere demon lord could do. Even Guy Crimson had not been able to evolve the primordials under his command. Thinking in that way, one could understand just how extraordinary Demon Lord Rimuru's actions were. Even so, that did not mean that Damrada was willing to lose. In order to fulfill his promise to Rudra, he needed to challenge the demon named Ultima with all his might.

"I don't always aim for the most reasonable path. Even if I choose the path of hardship, it's fine as long as the result achieves my goal." Damrada stopped worrying. Even after witnessing Ultima's overwhelming power, he took an undaunted stance.

"So, you're going to do it, huh?"

"Of course. I'll show you my power as His Majesty's knight."

"I'm looking forward to it. So then, let's begin!"

And so, the battle between Damrada, the second rank of the Single Digits, and Ultima, the 'Pain Lord', began.


![soft scene break]


Ultima watched Damrada with a thin smile. She could feel a power that was incredibly strong for a human. Even for a Saint, he was exceptional. His stance was so flawless that it might have been impossible for her to win had she not evolved.

*That's it. He seems to be comparable to Hinata-san. That person was like a natural enemy of monsters, but this guy seems to have refined his skill-level purely against interpersonal and individual opponents. That type of person is really troublesome, isn't it?*

As far as Ultima was concerned, opponents who had honed their skill-level were troublesome. Hakurou was a good example of this, as he was able to deal with all sorts of situations with a variety of techniques. The ability to apply power was the secret of his strength. It was something that had nothing to do with superior beings.

.........

......

...

A demon is an overwhelmingly superior existence in comparison to a human. Just releasing their mana is enough to make it an attack.

Ultima was one of the pinnacles of such demons. She was born knowing how to deal with mana and how to control mana perfectly. There was no need for effort. All she had to do was wish and it would come true. That was magic, and in the face of its overwhelming versatility, there was no opponent.

Until recently, Ultima had believed that the only beings that could defeat her were primordial beings of the same rank, or non-standard beings such as the True Dragons. However, that belief had been wrong. It was during the battle with Velgrynd that Ultima became aware of this.

Ultima and her team had put up a good fight against the overwhelmingly superior Velgrynd. They even succeeded in defeating one of the 'Split Bodies', albeit with only 10 percent of its power. In other words, she learned that if one misused their power, they could be defeated by a lower rank.

In the battles that followed, there were many more lessons to be learned.

A True Dragon, which was known as the strongest beings in the world, performed an elaborate and sophisticated manipulation of magic power. As a result, that power had overwhelmed Ultima, a race that excelled in magic, with magic. She hadn't known how that was possible while they were fighting. But now Ultima could understand. The secret was the act of adding an Ultimate Skill to magic.

*By using an Ultimate Skill, the control of magic becomes more precise. No wonder we couldn't beat her.*

Even the magic Velgrynd cast in check had been too powerful for Ultima to handle. As for Carrera, she had been humiliated more than anything else by the fact that she was being dealt with by a better version of the magic she was best at.

That right, it was a humiliation.

But it was also a blessing.

She had gotten the opportunity to experience that battle. And she had survived without being decisively defeated.

Until now, Ultima had never imagined that just by incorporating the effects of Skill into magic, it could be doubled in power. The experience of that battle had made her realize new possibilities.

*It's true that our basic abilities are very high. That said, relying too much on our potential is also a problem. With more ingenuity, one can become even stronger!*

Ultima, the strongest of beings, had never aspired to gain power before. But this time, she wished to have it too.

How much stronger could a powerful being who is already invincible become, if they strive and work hard to reach a higher level?

The answer was someone like Velgrynd and Guy Crimson, she supposed.

From that perspective, there was no doubt that Diablo, who only pursued his own interests, was outside the norm.

Testarossa, on the other hand, was completely different from Ultima and Carrera, who had never made any efforts.

Ultima was aware that she was the most inexperienced of the seven "primordials". Even so, she was probably on par with Mizeri and Raine... But if she fought seriously, she felt that she would lose to Testarossa and Carrera.

Testarossa was gracefully perfect. She was self-confident and had a bad habit of looking down on others.

Carrera was arrogant and unprincipled. She could do everything perfectly well if she wanted to, but she quickly lost interest and would leave things behind.

And Ultima was...

Ultima did not have as precise of a magic power manipulation as Testarossa, nor did she have as great a mana pool as Carrera. Of the three "devil lords" (excluding Diablo), Ultima was probably the weakest. She was half-hearted in everything she did, and although she was a mass of talent, she had no experience of working for anything with her whole heart.

In this way, Ultima and Carrera were similar in many respects. That's why they had been rivals for so long. Nevertheless, Carrera had recently found a hobby in swordsmanship. Ultima had honestly felt envious of that. But that would end today. Ultima was blessed with the opportunity to awaken and gain the power she wished for.

*That just means that I'm the one with the most room to grow!*

Ultima had come to think as such, and now it felt like a funny story.

This was all thanks to Rimuru, who had become her master.

Ultima did not know how Rimuru was able to do such things, but those thoughts were irrelevant. What mattered was whether she could become a superior being. And whether or not she could be of use to Rimuru.

While watching over Agera's battle, Ultima continued to wish. At the end of her contemplation, she thought she heard a mysterious voice.

![break]

<<In order to make this wish come true, let me help you just a little bit.>>

![break]

And the result was the Ultimate Skill 'Poison King Samael'.

It detected the weaknesses of all life forms and created a poison that induced a suitable state change. This was the power of the Ultimate Skill 'Poison King Samael'. Now that she had this power, Ultima had no intention of losing.

However---

Ultima suddenly remembered.

'Hone your skills and do not to rely too heavily on your strength'---that's what Diablo had always said. She had been losing to Zegion, so she had assumed that Diablo was just telling her off. She had also thought that Diablo was just being a jerk because he had a bad personality. But that was Ultima's misunderstanding. It was true that his words were laced with sarcasm, but he was also thinking of them.

How you control your power could make a world of difference in how strong you are---That was what Diablo was teaching them. After understanding that, she remembered Diablo's words.

*Simply relying on the power you have been given is not how to acquire it---it's certainly true!*

Ultima was now deeply convinced. It was a line that had been said to her right after she had received her name, but she now thought it was true.

*Come to think of it, Diablo wouldn't use the power given to him by Rimuru-sama unless he was in trouble. I thought it was just in contempt for the enemy, but I guess he had a good reason.*

'I will do the same'---Ultima decided to take advantage of this opportunity and use it to grow. Damrada was a tricky opponent, so this was a good time to give it all she had.

*Seriously. That Diablo, trying to teach us how to fight... He underestimates us too much, doesn't he? If Testa finds out that he thinks of us that way, she's going to get really mad and it'll be a big deal. Well, Testa might have just been taking advantage of the situation on purpose, but well, since this is a rare opportunity... I think I'll take advantage of it.*

Even Damrada, a formidable opponent, was nothing more than a training ground for Ultima. For the first time, she would use her Ultimate Skill and achieve victory. By doing so, Ultima would definitely grow.

Ultima swore to herself. She would win this battle, not by using the innate power that she always had, but by using the power that she had acquired from her desire to win.

By doing so, she would prove it.

Rather than just hoping, she could be of help to Rimuru---Ultima thought as such.

.........

......

...

The battle was extremely fierce.

Ultima's attacks were outmatched by Damrada's techniques. In some cases, Damrada was able to offset Ultima head-on by concentrating all of his energy. It was Damrada's ability to react quickly and flexibly that made him so powerful. Ultima was frankly impressed by this and found it amusing. She realized a lot of things in the fight against Damrada.

*I see, so this kind of flow keeps the body intact. In that case, this is an approach that might work with Zegion-san!*

Zegion was so powerful that she was defeated the moment she got close. That was not suitable for combat training, let alone actual combat. On the other hand, Damrada was a most suitable opponent.

Ultima realized how fortunate she had been. With her overwhelming mana, she could easily defend against any attack. She could have crushed any foe with brute force alone. She had thought she understood this, but now it was fully recognized with more realism.

The power of both sides increased, and the battle grew more intense.


![hard scene break]


The two were evenly matched in strength, and the outcome was still uncertain. Or so it seemed at first glance...

"Hahaha, this is fun! I couldn't last this long against Zegion-san."

Ultima seemed to be enjoying herself. Damrada, on the other hand, had a bitter expression on his face.

"Treating this fight as a training session... You're playing me as a fool." Despite saying this, Damrada was aware of it in his heart. If this continued, Damrada was the one who would be defeated. Ultima was still growing, but Damrada was already at full strength. He had no time to enjoy the thrill of this battle, and was using all of his skills just to try to defeat Ultima.

In the first place, a primordial demon was essentially the poster child of magic. Against an existence that could even rewrite the physical laws of the world, a half-hearted attack would not work. Therefore, Damrada was inflicting damage to Ultima by adding the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' effect to all of his attacks. Having spent more than 2,000 years studying it, he could exercise its powers as if it were breathing. It had become so familiar to Damrada that he had forgotten that it had been lent to him by Rudra. In addition, a demon had its shackles. Although this one seemed to have been released now, there was a limit to the amount of magicules they could possess. Because of this, the 'Saint' Damrada had a higher total amount of energy compared to Ultima. That was why he was only just able to compete with Ultima on equal terms.

*The more I attack, the more I am exposing my hand, but even using my big move may not be effective. This is... Unwinnable, huh?*

Damrada coughed up blood. Ultima was stealing the skills that he had worked so hard to acquire. It would have been better if she had decided to make quick work of this, but she knew that such a move would leave her open to self-destruction.

Even now, he was able to cancel out all of Ultima's multiple attacks of the same power at the same time, but Ultima was not frustrated---she looked happy.

"That's awesome, just like a demonstration!"

Now it was Damrada's turn to feel frustrated. Damrada was now cornered. He was in no position to show off his skills, and as soon as he showed them, she would copy him. Just like a dry sand absorbing water, he could feel that Ultima was growing.

*Hahaha, I can only laugh.* He couldn't help but laugh at himself.

Damrada could never have imagined how horrifying these "primordials" were. To an outsider, it might seem as if their abilities were on par with each other. However, that balance would soon be broken. As long as one side continued to grow, the scales would eventually tilt in her favor. That was the stark reality. And that time would come.

"Aha! I'm starting to get it!"

As soon as she shouted this, the aura around Ultima changed. Until now, she had been saving her power to steal Damrada's technique. After releasing her power, six pairs of twelve total wings spread out on Ultima's back. Like the wings of a bat, the featherless flight apparatuses were glossy, smooth, and glowed a light purple.

"Here we go!"

"Kuh?!"

After Ultima shouted, the twelve wings began to move simultaneously. They changed shape in a variety of ways as they aimed at Damrada. Some were as thin as blades, some were as sharp as needles, and some were clumped together like fists. The ever-changing wings made them very difficult to escape from, let alone deal with...

Damrada tried to parry the fist-shaped one, but was blown away as soon as he made contact. The force of the blow was incomparably greater than anything Damrada had seen before, and it was so fierce that Damrada could not cancel it out. Moreover, to his horror, Ultima's power was increasing rapidly. Now that there was no upper limit to the amount of magicule, it seemed as if her power would increase as much as she wanted it to, and there was no sign of her momentum decreasing.

"Chi!!!"

"Hahahaha! I love that kind of expression."

"Hmph! Don't mess with me, little girl. The power is amazing, but I simply have to avoid being hit."

Damrada summoned up more energy than ever before and concentrated on avoiding the attack. Although he acted as if he was fine, he felt a growing sense of danger inside him. He couldn't win at this rate. But Ultima remained untouched.

If there was no opening, he would have to make one---Damrada dared to take a desperate action.

One of the wings pierced Damrada's leg. It looked like Damrada had failed to avoid it, but that was exactly what Damrada was planning. As a race that prided themselves on their great power, demons were prone to arrogance. Damrada's goal was to act on the assumption that even Ultima would be caught off guard if she was sure of her victory.

"Ahahahaha, I thought you were going to keep avoiding them? Or did you get tired?"

With a wicked grin, Ultima relaxed her attack and began to torment Damrada. The wings began to move as if to pierce the extremities, not the vital parts.

*I know. You're strong. That's why you look down on us and fail at the critical moment.*

Damrada was convinced that his plan would succeed. He pretended to be injured and fell down, then attempted to strike Ultima with all his might.

"Seihahouken^[I didn't really read into the kanji for this, but it's something like an ultimate fist attack.]!"

This was Damrada's special move. It was a blow made up with the full power of a Saint's fighting spirit, tempered with 'Alternative'. No matter how powerful a creature it was, it would disappear if hit by this move. Even the primordial Ultima had no choice but to disappear if her body was destroyed.

Damrada thought he had won, but he did not feel the aftermath of his victory. For some reason, he felt a chill as he tried to finish off Ultima.

What collapsed was a piece of a wing that had fallen away. It seemed to have changed shape to resemble Ultima, but Damrada was unable to see it. By the time he realized it, it was too late.

"Death Poison Fist!"

Ultima pierced Damrada's chest.

![full page image](image6)

In imitation of Damrada, she concentrated a huge amount of mana in her piercing hand, but she controlled it perfectly by activating her Ultimate Skill 'Poison King Samael'. Moreover, the five fingernails were dyed purple due to the 'deadly poison' that was from the 'Poison King Samael'. Damrada's defense was crushed by the power of the poison, which far exceeded the lethal dose. With this, the outcome of victory or defeat had been decided.

"Guh!!" Damrada coughed up blood and collapsed on the spot.

"Ahahahaha, my bad! I was right on target!!" It was a wicked roar of laughter that rang out.

Damrada tried to stand up again, but failed. All the strength had drained out of his body and he could not stand up or even clench his fists. Still, he gathered his strength to look up and glare at Ultima.

"Fool, that's not a fist attack. That was a piercing hand. You only saw it once, so you can't imitate me... But that power is unmistakable...truly wonderful. Brilliant. It would be more appropriate to call it 'Bloody Bite'."

And with that, Damrada looked up to the sky in satisfaction. As he looked up, he smiled a little ruefully. This battle had been a complete defeat. Before they could challenge Guy to a decisive battle, they were crushed by Demon Lord Rimuru. Some of the elite may survive, but it would be impossible to rebuild.

Emperor Rudra did not have the strength to wait for the next opportunity. Before then, the current Rudra would already have been---

"Your Majesty..."---Damrada whispered, reflecting on his life.

.........

......

...

"Damrada, can I have your attention?"

"What is it? If you want to complain about something, just talk to Velgrynd-sama. Or are you complaining about Velgrynd-sama? If so, direct it to her, and not me. I don't want her to think that I'm complaining too."

"You're such a cold person---no, that's not what I meant. I'm serious."

"...Pardon? What is it?"

He didn't want to hear it. From the moment he had looked into Rudra's eyes, he knew that it was serious. But once he listened to it, they wouldn't be able to have the relationship they had now. Damrada didn't like that.

"Apparently, my mind wears out every time I reincarnate. Or rather, in Guy's words, it's probably the 'soul', but that's not important. What's important is that I eventually might not be me anymore."

As a 'Hero', Rudra's reincarnation was not due to magic. It was a special ritual to inherit his overpowering power.

There was a price for a mortal to gain power that surpassed even that of the True Dragons, the ultimate spirit life forms. It was Rudra's own right to control it. Therefore, Damrada could not offer a solution...

"A wearing of the soul, huh? After that, Your Majesty will cease to be yourself..."

"Ahh, that's right."

"That's a funny joke. But I'm not so naive as to take that seriously and shorten your workload."

"Che, you're still such a serious guy, aren't you?"

"I believe that's my strong point."

"Hah, that's true. I just said something boring, so forget it."

"Yeah. I'll do that."

How could he forget?

Damrada had only run away. He wanted to keep the relationship as it was, and he wanted to serve Rudra forever.

And then, time passed on.

"Ahhh, I knew it. It seems that every time I'm reborn, I lose something important. The problem is, I don't even know what it is."

"Your Majesty..."

"Hey, Damrada."

"Yes."

"This is an order. If I'm no longer myself, you will kill me with your own hands."

"Rudra-sama!"

"There's no way I could ask Velgrynd to do this, right?"

'I can't do this either'---Damrada swallowed those words with all his might. If this was his best friend Rudra's heartfelt wish, then there was no way he could say no.

"Good grief, you're weak. But if that should happen, I promise I'll take care of Rudra-sama. So don't worry, just rest assured and work hard in your affairs."

"Fufu, you're still the same as usual. I'm in good hands."

That was the promise of a distant day.

And then, more time passed---

![break]

"I'm tired. There is a limit to how much I can control my 'Justice King Michael'. Absolute justice, when you get right down to it, is not much different from evil. There is no such thing as a justice that all people recognize in this world."

"Your Majesty..."

"Damrada, the promise we made, do you remember?"

"Of course I do."

When Rudra heard the reply, he smiled, saying "That's good."

Changing his expression, he gave the order solemnly.

"Damrada, I have an order. Just in case you fail, find me someone who can defeat Justice King Michael and defeat me! It pains me to ask this of you, but...while I am still myself, I must make sure everything is in order."

The order was equivalent to an order to kill Rudra himself, but Damrada could only nod.

"Your orders, I understand."

Upon hearing Damrada's reply, Rudra muttered, "I'm sorry." As if talking to himself, Rudra looked off into the distance and began to speak.

"Looking back, the 'Justice King Michael' entrusted to me by my friend may have been too powerful for me. Whether I win or lose in this game with Guy, this will be my last use of it. I want to fully master this Skill, but...if it shows any signs of getting out of control, do not hesitate. You must stop me."

"I will."

"---Thank you." As soon as he said this, Rudra closed his eyes. Then he remembered the vow he had made to Veldanava, the Star King Dragon a long time ago, and felt frustrated that he could not keep it.

A small murmur escaped from his mouth---"If I fail to fulfill my promise, I will apologize to you in the afterlife."

Damrada pretended not to have heard this, and quietly left the room.

.........

......

...

Choking on the blood leaking from his mouth, Damrada was jolted back to reality. For less than a few tenths of a second, he seemed to have lost consciousness.

*---Your Majesty, I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I... I was unable to fulfill your order...*

In his fading consciousness, Damrada tried to express his regret. But it was not to be, and he could only vomit blood once again.

Regret.

However, there was also a sense of relief.

The order to seek out those who would murder his beloved lord---it had been painful for Damrada. He had been suffering for a long time. It was only natural. Because to Damrada, Emperor Rudra was still the same glorious champion had had always been.

*You... I couldn't possibly kill you!! Why me? Why can't it be someone else? I have no attachment to this world if you no longer exist here. I wish to go with you on your journey from death...*

That was what Damrada truly wished for in his heart.

The game between Guy and Rudra didn't matter to Damrada. What mattered to him was Rudra's will, and the world that reflected it.

Guy Crimson was an arrogant demon lord, but he was not an unreasonable tyrant. His rule was absolute, but he also had set proper rules for himself and stubbornly kept to them. Guy and Rudra's ideals were different, but they were never incompatible. From Damrada's point of view, they seemed to be perfectly capable of compromise.

Guy would not make a move on his own. Rudra must have given his orders to Damrada because he was sure of that.

Why did they insist on fighting when it's clear that there was mutual recognition?

That was Damrada's question.

But there was no way he could disobey Rudra's orders, and in the end, he followed them and began his activities around the world. Long after leaving the Emperor's service, a candidate was found. A boy named Yuuki Kagurazaka, who possessed the super peculiar constitution of 'Anti-Skill'. Damrada had thought that he would be able to defeat the Justice King Michael if he could nullify even the Ultimate Skill, but the result had been a disastrous defeat. Yuuki had fallen into Rudra's hands, and he could no longer be relied upon. Thus, Damrada lost his trump card, but now a question arose.

"...Why, Your Majesty Rudra, did you take control of Yuuki?"

"Huh, what?" Ultima asked back, an unintentional murmur escaping her lips.

Without answering, Damrada continued to ponder. Rudra himself was the one who had ordered Damrada to find someone who could kill him. And yet he didn't see why he should interfere with that.

No, it wasn't that. It's just that Damrada didn't want to admit it. The signs had been there all along.

"---So, after all... His Majesty Rudra-sama is already..." Damrada muttered as if in a fever.

"What the hell are you talking about?!" Ultima shouted in frustration, but her voice did not reach Damrada.

Damrada was now lost in his own thoughts. It was like a flash of inspiration before death, but Damrada's thoughts were now clear. Therefore, he would arrive at the truth.

![break]

Rudra burned with passion for his ideals.

He would unite the world and establish lasting peace. He dreamed of an end to strife and poverty and the development of mankind. Once all mankind was united and at peace, everyone would be able to live equally.

Rudra believed in this and set out to establish a unified nation. He believed that human beings were capable of understanding each other. He believed from the bottom of his heart that they could eventually unite into a single will and create a better world. He became a hero for the sake of the people and took upon great hardships. Rudra was working hard for the hope that many people would live a happy life.

Damrada liked such a Rudra.

But---

Rudra's ideal remained a dream.

It couldn't be helped that Rudra himself had changed before the day of fulfillment arrived.

*The ideals we pursued turned out to be crushed long ago...*

Damrada acknowledged this and was filled with a deep sadness.

"Are you crying?"

"...Ahhh..."

"Because you're afraid of dying?"

"...No. Because I made a promise---"

"A promise?"

"...Ahhh..."

The inevitability of death had gripped Damrada.

He had no choice but to resign himself to the fact that there was nothing he could do about it, yet Damrada couldn't stand the fact that he was unable to keep his promise to Rudra.

If Rudra's will had disappeared, then who was Rudra now? There was only one answer to that question. It had to be the Ultimate Skill 'Justice King Michael'---the ultimate power given to Rudra by his friend 'Star King Dragon' Veldanava.

Before Rudra's mind had collapsed, Damrada needed to fulfill the imperial order. And yet...apparently, he was unable to do so, and Damrada's life was coming to an end. Damrada wanted to curse his own incompetence, but he reminded himself that the situation was not yet at its worst. He had to stop the 'Justice King Michael' at all costs. If Damrada failed, he would have to find someone else to take over the task. It was an order from Rudra, and a promise that Damrada had to keep.

Damrada had found Yuuki, but he knew of one other person. The dreaded demon lord, Rimuru. His greatest enemy was also his greatest hope.

"May I ask you to kill His Majesty...Rudra-sama...?"

"What? Why me?"

"It doesn't have to be you. But to the demon lord, Rimuru...this message...can't you ask...?"

"No, just let me take care of that. We were going to kill this Rudra guy anyway, not that we couldn't accept your request."

Ultima's character did as she pleased. She was fickle, so she didn't take things lying down, but she liked Damrada. It had been a short fight, but for Ultima, who had an infinite lifespan, quality was better than quantity. Just the taste of the concentrated and intense fight made her feel like she could forgive everything.

"Then, one more thing...want to ask..."

"What?"

"That person...a boy named Masayuki...please protect him..."

Damrada was sure of it.

Masayuki was---

"Well, that's fine. But it comes at a cost, you know?"

The devil did not work for free.

It was not an absolute rule, so there were plenty of ways around it. But this time, Ultima was being selfish. She wanted to annoy Damrada, so she asked the question. However, upon hearing Ultima's question, Damrada felt relieved. With a sense of peace that liberated his mind, he replied calmly.

"The reward is all that I have. My soul as well...all of my Skills. I leave it to you."

"Accepted, I guess."

Looking at Ultima, who gave a reluctant reply, Damrada's expression broke.

And then...

"---Your Majesty Rudra...now, I will go to your side..."

Those were Damrada's last words.

Damrada breathed his last as if falling asleep.

Damrada, the former Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nasca and close friend of the united Emperor Rudra Nam Ul Nasca.

The 'Fist Saint' Damrada's long life had finally come to an end.

![break]

Ultima stood alone in the circular colosseum in the isolated space.

"Ahh, how boring. The nucleus is gone. I was going to give it to Rimuru-sama, but..." Ultima murmured sadly, and gently wrapped Damrada's body in her twelve wings.

In accordance with her contract, she had taken all of Damrada for herself. And that was the end of it.

It was the end of the battle between Damrada and Ultima.

![break]

---The life of the "Fist Saint" had come to an end, and a new "Fist Demon" was born---

![break]

Damrada, in his last moment, had given the deadliest power to one of the most vicious demons.

If he had known, would he have felt ashamed of himself? Or perhaps he was happy to have a successor to his technique. Now that Damrada was gone, there was no way to know.

Those who survived could only consider this question in their hearts.


![hard scene break]


"Come, I will be your opponent," Agera announced to Kondou in the center of the colosseum.

Kondou's eyebrows twitched, and he silently put his hand on his sword. He did not respond to Agera, but glanced at Carrera.

"You can relax. I'm only here as a witness."

"Nonsense. I can't trust you."

Kondou finally opened his mouth, but his words were quite scathing. They were enemies anyway, so he was telling them to come at him at the same time. Carrera, however, was unmoved.

"Well, I suppose you're right. I don't think two against one is cowardly, and I'm not planning to go easy on you, however this time, it's Agera's wish. Don't worry about me and just have fun." She said as much as she could before sitting down along the stone wall as if she had nothing to do with this. Kondou shrugged his shoulders and replied.

"What a farce. But I'll give you credit for your spirit." Then he drew his sword and confronted Agera.

"I thank you. Now then, let's get---" His words were cut short by a loud bang. Agera collapsed to the ground, clutching his chest.

"You!"

Carrera, who had closed the distance in the blink of an eye, stepped in between Kondou and Agera. Kondou swung his sword to cut off Agera's head, but was stopped by Carrera's sword.

"Hmph. Can you make it at this speed?" Kondou said to Carrera, holding a smoking Nambu pistol in his right hand and wielding a single sword in his left.

"You knew I couldn't make it in time, didn't you? If you were serious, Agera would have been wiped out by now, right?"

Kondou had never said he would accept the match against Agera, so this was Agera's own fault for not checking. Besides, the final blow was not serious at all. Carrera, who had caught the sword, understood this fact best.

Someone as strong as Kondou would not have lost even if he fought Agera head on. If it was only a sword fight, it would have been close, but even so, Kondou's victory would have been unassailable in the end. Even so, Kondou made a surprise attack because Carrera had been on the sidelines. Believing the words of an enemy was outrageous, so it would be foolish to listen to the words of a devil. Eliminating uncertainty was an ironclad rule of warfare.

"Well now, just what are you talking about? I don't have time for that nonsense." Kondou turned to Carrera and sneered at the state of affairs.

"Well, that's all right. If you're up for it, I'll be your next opponent."

"With that sword?"

Kondou pointed to Carrera's sword, which had cracked under the blow. If she struck it again and again, it would surely break, and Carrera would not be oblivious to that.

"No way. There are alternatives, only I've got something better than that. Agera, you understand."

"...Of course. It is a shame that I could not cross swords with a descendant of my own school, but considering that you follow my teachings, I cannot complain. What I do not like is that he made a fool of me and deprived me of my fighting power."

Saying this, Agera stood up. Already, the hole in his chest had been filled. The bullet that Kondou shot Agera with was called an "Eraser," and it had the effect of dissipating as much energy as the mana it was loaded with. If it had been the "Necrosis", Agera would have had difficulty standing up.

As Carrera and Agera realized, it was obvious that Kondou had cut corners. However---that was why Agera could still fight.

"Blade Transformation."

Agera was transformed into a single sword. Needless to say, Carrera was the one who took it in hand. Carrera's mana filled Agera, and his lost energy was restored. As a result, the blade glowed, showing that Agera was full of energy.

"How foolish. I would have let you off the hook if I believed you were a fellow comrade..."

"My dependents love to fight, so it's none of your business."

"I see. Well, it's not important now. That person committed the unforgivable sin of impersonating the founder of the art. I will do everything in my power to make him pay."

To Kondou, the Carrera who was holding Agera in her hands was just as guilty. He bared his clear hostility and showed his seriousness.

![break]

Half an hour had passed since the battle began. Carrera was kneeling on the ground. Incredibly, Kondou was showing to be terribly strong. A master, indeed. Even to Carrera, he was a monster beyond imagination.

Carrera knew that she was strong. But at the same time, she understood that there were stronger people out there. In fact, even if she couldn't beat Diablo, one might have thought that she wouldn't lose to anyone else. And yet, Zegion had beaten her easily.

In this war as well, she had been completely outmatched against Velgrynd.

So even though she was at Kondou's mercy, she wasn't surprised. On the contrary, she felt excited and uplifted.

Carrera rolled on the ground to keep distance from Kondou. She then stood up and took up the seigan stance^["Seigan stance/Seigan-no-kamae" can be translated to something like "right posture" and is the basic sword stance used in most traditional schools of swordsmanship. It is also called "Chūdan-no-kamae" or "middle-level posture."] once again.

"You're good! Even Agera complimented my swordsmanship, but it seems I am still no match for you."

"Shut up. I am only trying to use all my power to defeat my opponent, saying that is upsetting."

Kondou, true to himself, found Carrera's sense of combat very uncanny. Now was not the time to be fooling around, so he had been going all out from the start. He was using not only his sword skills but also his Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon' without any hesitation. And yet, he was unable to finish Carrera off. That alone was astonishing, and Kondou shuddered inwardly. It seemed that they were not easy opponents, and both had recognized one another. From that point on, the battle intensified.

Carrera struck Kondou with a powerful sword blow, blocking his movements. Kondou parried the sword lightly and aimed at Carrera with the gun in his right hand. The power contained in the bullet was to disarm magic. The bullet was called "Dispel." The reason Kondou fired it could be seen in Carrera's next action.

Without any chanting, a gravitational force field was formed instantly. Kondou noted that this was a feat of strength, but rather than reflecting on it, Carrera resorted to more power, invoking a spell that did not affect her, and hoping to block Kondou's movement.

Anticipating this, Kondou chose to use "Dispel." This versatility was Kondou's strength. The Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon' had four main effects, and Kondou used them differently depending on the time and situation.

"Remove" broke the target's Defense Barrier.

"Dispel" counteracted magic effects.

"Necrosis" destroyed the target's mana circuit.

"Eraser" was a high-density mana bullet. It also drained energy by detecting the nature of the target.

All of these effects were combined in "Judgment," the most powerful bullet of all.

Carrera had always been one to chant spells in her magic attacks. It was a stepping stone to this time, but all of those spells were lifted the moment she cast them. Kondou's reading had been accurate, and he had made the right choice. Moreover, he would fire various kinds of bullets at any opportunity.

If Carrera didn't recognize the nature of the bullets and deal with them properly, she would be hurt badly. If she had been careless, the game would have been over in an instant.

Kondou had analyzed the battle very calmly. He did not show any emotion and was even mechanical about it. He saw through the enemy's weaknesses and the flow of mana and took the most appropriate action.

That was all.

By sticking to the basics, Kondou had maintained his position as the strongest in the Imperial Army. This was in stark contrast to Carrera, who let her emotions get the better of her, yet the two were very similar. Carrera shook her head in dismay and asked Kondou in a friendly manner.

"That's tricky. How did you know I was going to use magic?"

Kondou also responded to Carrera, gesturing for her to catch her breath.

"Huh, that's simple. It's because that's what I would do if I were you, I guess."

"I see. That really is a simple explanation."

Once again, Carrera was impressed by this Kondou man. At the same time, she realized that Kondou was the most powerful enemy she had ever faced.

*How can he just read the flow of mana used to activate the spell and cut off the flow? How can he just say that?*

'That's what I would do'---was what he said. What a terrible excuse. Carrera felt bitter, but her expression was unable to hide her joy. It was nice to know that there was someone you could fight with all your might.

Demon Lord Leon was a strong opponent that Guy recognized. It was supposed to be a satisfying fight, but Carrera's challenge had not been met with any response. It had been disappointing, annoying, and frustrating, but...with Kondou as her opponent, she could enjoy the fight to the fullest. To Carrera, the process of fighting was more important than winning or losing.

"That's good, very good. It's Kondou, right? You're the best enemy I've ever had!"

Carrera praised him sincerely, but Kondou only snorted and brushed it off. He did not speak in words, but gave his opinion with his sword. A sharp slash was launched at Carrera. Even though he was swinging with only his left hand, his sword line did not waver, and was even more beautiful than the demonstration of a master.

Carrera dealt with Kondou's continuous slashes, relying on Agera's skill and her own intuition. After a brief exchange of sword clashes, Carrera discovered that Kondou had a few quirks.

A sword in his left hand, a gun in his right. This was Kondou's fighting style, but at the moment of firing his gun, his eyes and fingertips were linked, and she could read the line of fire of the bullets. It was a small quirk that only someone like Carrera could have detected, but it was still a fatal flaw that was more than enough to decide the match.

*Here!*

With perfect timing, Carrera swung her sword. Kondou, who was about to fire his gun, could not react to the movement. As if without thinking, he forced himself to hold up his gun to deflect Carrera's sword. His reaction speed was impressive, but that was not enough to stop Carrera.

"Don't underestimate me! I've taken away one of your trump cards!"

Kondou twisted his body into an impossible position to resist, but it seemed that he could not resist Carrera's strength. He was forced to let go of the gun. The Nambu pistol rolled to the ground. Carrera was elated that she had given Kondou the slip.

But then---

There was a creepy sensation. As soon as she felt it, Carrera instinctively jumped back from the spot.

It was Kondou's sword that slashed through the air.

"Damn, I failed to finish it."

Carrera's severed left arm fell to the ground with a thud. It was cut off by Kondou's sword, as if without any regard to the orichalcum skeleton.

"You bastard!!"

Carrera is furious, but her mind was calm. She acknowledged the reality of the situation while trembling with humiliation. She would never be able to beat Kondou at this rate. As proof of this, Kondou was now holding a military sword with both hands. His form was one of perfected beauty, and even his demeanor was different from before.

She had no choice but to accept that Kondou did not intend to rely on the gun from the beginning. His purpose had been to lure Carrera by daring to create an opening. If that was the case, Carrera had been underestimated by Kondou. He could have fought her with just her sword, but he didn't show it and instead played tricks on her...

*It was probably just a trick to make it easier for him to kill me, but...how could such an expert do such a despicable thing as not showing his full strength? That's unforgivable.* Recognizing this, Carrera roared.

"How dare you underestimate me, a human!!"

In a fit of rage, Carrera tried to take a step forward to tear Kondou to pieces.

But at that moment...

<Please wait, Carrera-sama.>

Agera, who had been transformed into Carrera's sword, spoke to Carrera.

![break]

Carrera and Agera were now in a state of near unity. Naturally, they were connected by a 'telepathy net', so they could talk to each other with their minds. And so, in the field of consciousness that had been stretched a millionfold by Carrera's power, they began to talk.

<What is it, Agera? I'm busy right now, so if you interrupt me, I'll kill you too.>

<Calm down, Carrera-sama. If you lose your cool like that, Kondou will have his way.>

<I know what I'm doing. But he made me look like a fool. Me, the king? I'll never forgive him.>

Lately, it had become Agera's role to stop Carrera, but even Agera had never seen Carrera as angry as she was today. If he didn't stop her now, Carrera would inevitably lose. Agera earnestly tried to persuade Carrera.

<Listen. The reason Kondou did not resort to the sword from the beginning was not because he underestimated Carrera-sama.>

<Why not? No matter how you look at it, he's underestimating me!>

<No, he's not. Rather, it's for the exact opposite reason.>

<Huh?>

<Because he perceived Carrera-sama as a threat, Kondou is trying to keep his cards close to his chest. Not everyone is born as strong as Carrera-sama. It's only natural for a warrior to be mindful of fighting a strong enemy!>

<Then what is it? Are you saying that he approves of me?>

<That's right!!>

Agera was making points here and there. Kondou's style was complete in its own way, but in his essence, he was a swordsman who had inherited Agera's style. There was no doubt that Kondou's style was more serious, but that was why he did not expose it from the beginning and instead switched to it at the right moment. The gap he showed when firing the gun must have been created by his nerve-wracking training. He must have used it because he recognized Carrera as a strong opponent. Otherwise, he would not have dared to take such a risk by making such an elaborate move.

<...I see, that's true, if you say so...>

Thanks to Agera's persuasion, Carrera regained her composure and agreed. Agera breathed a sigh of relief.

<I'm sorry for worrying you, Agera. Thanks to you, I've come to my senses.>

<I'm glad to hear that.>

<I promise not to worry you anymore.>

With that declaration, Carrera turned to Kondou once again. Then, without hesitation, a fist struck her once in the face. At such a blow, one would wonder how Carrera's head didn't explode. However, Carrera did not care and even smiled at Kondou.

"Hey, I didn't scare you, did I? I'm sorry, I just slightly lost my cool because I mistakenly thought you underestimated me. Even so, it's amazing what humans can do. They really do have a lot of tricks up their sleeve to win. I was a little surprised because I had never thought of that."

Carrera laughed but knew not to underestimate the enemy. She was not careless, but without Agera, she would have been taken in by Kondou's schemes.

The Carrera of today was not the Carrera of the past where selfishness was acceptable.

As a loyal subordinate of the Demon Lord Rimuru, she now acted in accordance to the orders of her lord. Aside from defeat, she could not afford to die. Carrera warned herself in her mind. That blow had been for that very purpose, and as a statement of her resolve.

Carrera now acknowledged Kondou. The two of them were equals. It was a very serious thought, not typical of Carrera's casual nature.

"What a surprise. You know... I never really thought of humans as real opponents...but now I am taking them seriously."

Perhaps it was the pride of being the strongest race that always made her unconsciously fail to use her full strength when fighting others. Even so, she had mistakenly assumed that Kondou had not been giving it his all and had to be admonished by Agera. Carrera realized her mistake and finally got serious.

Kondou looked at the ghastly grin on Carrera's face and felt that it was beautiful.

"Is the demon getting serious? As a vulnerable human, that is not something I should welcome."

For the first time, his expression changed, and he recognized Carrera as the enemy.

"Then, I, too, must take you seriously." Kondou declared, putting on his "armor" for the first time.

It was no longer the uniform that relied on the power of will, but a pure white spiritual armor that was a variation of the mythical-grade armaments given to him by Rudra. It resembled the ceremonial robes of the old Imperial Navy. While it was not that big of a change in appearance, the atmosphere was that of a different person.

For Kondou, the ceremonial robe of his naval days was also a garment for death. As a lieutenant, he had caused the deaths of his men, and he had vowed to live with the guilt. In order to remember that resolve, he wore these garbs in battle.

Carrera looked at Kondou and released mana in a deep and loud voice. Then, she said her name.

"I am a loyal servant of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, and one of the Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords. "Menace Lord" Carrera. I will kill you upon my pride."

Kondou responded.

"I am Tatsuya Kondou, a former lieutenant in the Imperial Navy. I am now the Commander of the Imperial Guardians, and I accept your challenge."

The two sides stared at each other, quietly building up their strength.

Now, the real battle would begin.


![soft scene break]


Carrera picked up her fallen left arm and lightly touched the cut surface. And just like that, the pieces were back together as if nothing had happened.

"That's unreasonable."

"Now, don't say that. Rimuru-sama gave me this precious body, so I can't leave a single scar."

They were talking in a light tone, but both of them were looking for an opening. Kondou waited for Carrera's arm to heal because he had his own agenda.

Now that he had given up his pistol, Kondou would fight with only his sword. This was the true nature of the "Oboro Shinmei-ryu", but it also meant that he had no other options left. Kondou was now serious. This meant that Kondou was betting everything he had. Now that he held the sword in both hands, he was confident that he could defeat any enemy.

Kondou used his Unique Skill 'Decipherer' to read Carrera's movements. He could read not only the movement of her muscles, but also the flow of mana that filled her body, and even the signs of magic being activated.

This ability was linked to the Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon', and its performance was far beyond the realm of the unique-level. For that reason, he didn't miss the fact that Carrera's power had begun to grow abnormally.

A tremendous energy that seemed to symbolize Carrera's tyranny. And yet, as if unified by a great will, there was no stagnation in its flow. The energy that would normally have produced an explosive torrent was perfectly under Carrera's control.

*What a monster*---Kondou thought. The arm that he had taken so much trouble to cut off---now there was not even a trace of it left. Even her clothes had been mended. What a joke.

The focus of her raging energy was the sword that Agera has transformed into. The circulation of power was complete, thanks to the fact that he and Carrera were one and the same. From Kondou's point of view, this was an abhorrent situation, and he found it even more troubling. Incredibly, at the center of Carrera's mana, a fearsome crystal of power was forming.

Kondou had an idea of what it was. He knew it because he had acquired it himself. It was something that could only be seen when the form of the heart materialized.

*This person... I'm sure of it. Is she trying to acquire an Ultimate Skill?!*

As soon as he confirmed this, Kondou moved. No matter how powerful the enemy was, they needed to be eliminated quickly. That was the reason why he put on the ceremonial robe, a sign of his seriousness. In other words, defeat was not allowed. No matter what means were used, he had to win. It was the side of the victor that was justice.

While examining Carrera, Kondou finished his preparations. All that remained was his sword. With all his might, he slashed at Carrera.

"Good, good! You're giving me such a thrill with those unhesitating eyes!"

Kondou swung his sword, paying no heed to Carrera's gleeful cries. Although it was caught by Carrera's demon sword, Kondou's sword was very powerful. If it had not been for Agera's will, it might have been broken by the blow. Kondou added another series of blows.

"You?!"

Carrera groaned as she was struck by the sharp and heavy slash. The secret of the power lay in the intent behind the sword.

Kondou's Ultimate Skill, 'Conviction King Sandalphon', was not just a power that could be put into a bullet. It was only when Kondou's will was embedded in his sword, which could be called his soul, that it showed its true essence. That was Kondou's inner workings and his true form.

![break]

Kondou's onslaught began, and Carrera was on the defensive. Kondou was determined to end the battle before Carrera awakened to her ultimate power. Using every technique at his disposal, he hunted Carrera down. Even though Carrera controlled her violence and showed great power, Kondou parried everything without changing his expression.

Kondou's fighting skills were superior to Carrera's. The reason why the battle was barely viable was that Carrera had a huge amount of magicules and Agera's skill-level was added onto it. If it wasn't for that, Carrera would have been destroyed long ago.

Even now, the slash that contained the power of "Eraser" was cutting through Carrera's left side. Carrera's mana circuits had been disrupted by the effects of "Necrosis" in several slashes to her limbs. As a result, even the assimilation of Carrera and Agera had begun to be affected.

"You..." Carrera groaned, glaring at Kondou with bared teeth.

It had been a miscalculation. She knew Kondou was strong, but she had thought she could handle him as long as she put her mind to it. However, Kondou was not that easy of an opponent. Even with the help of Agera, Kondou was still a superhuman who could surpass Carrera.

*A human... A human being!! Even if he was awakened to a Saint, I never thought that a mere human would be able to push me this far...*

Carrera contemplated her own ineptitude and put her right hand on her left side where mana was leaking out from the slash. She tried to promote recovery, but it was ineffective because her mana circuits had been messed up.

Normally, a wound of that magnitude could be repaired without a conscious thought. And yet, it was like this even when she was aware of it. No matter how bold and rough Carrera was, she knew that her current condition was the worst.

The strength of one's will determined one's strength. What's more, Kondou was a man who had acquired the ultimate power on his own. Compared to Carrera, who had an infinite lifespan and spent her days at will, Kondou was simply incomparable.

Only now, along with the pain that tormented her, did Carrera finally understand.

A Skill was meaningless if it was merely given. It was only through the desire to acquire it that its essence could truly be utilized.

In terms of race, physical prowess, and vitality, Carrera had the upper hand. Thanks to Agera's Skill, they were even on par. And yet, she was unable to win. On the contrary, they were on the verge of defeat.

*At this rate, I'll lose? In other words---death? Me, the most powerful---a pillar of the primordial demons?!*

That was absolutely unacceptable.

Carrera's pride would not allow it. Above all, it would be going against the orders of Carrera's beloved lord, Demon Lord Rimuru.

If it turned out that way, it would be a big mistake that could not be redeemed even by killing herself a million times. Carrera felt fear. The inability to comply with Rimuru's orders had terrified Carrera, who had never before known what fear was.

"I absolutely will not accept that!" Carrera shouted, glaring at Kondou with bloodshot eyes.

Forcing the wound to regenerate, she prepared herself.

Carrera prayed even more deeply and intensely.

A desire for victory against the man in front of her.

Up until now, Carrera had fought only with her own pure demonic power. But that wasn't enough. Those who had awakened to the ultimate level could never be reached. Just like Diablo, and just like Kondou before her.

She now understood that she would never be able to defeat those who had awakened to the ultimate power. Even more so, she could never be a match for Guy Crimson, the one at the top. It was not enough just to think about increasing power. If that was the case, no matter how hard she tried, she would only end up as food for the strong.

Carrera finally understood after she had been driven to this point. If one truly wanted to fight the strong, one needed to understand themselves more deeply. To do this, what she needed above all, was a strong will.

This was the moment when Carrera, a spiritual organism, sought the power of will, which was her essence.

![break]

<<If so, let me help a little.>>

![break]

She felt as if she heard such a voice.

In that next moment, the "something" that had been moving deep inside of Carrera took a clearer shape. Carrera turned her attention to it. Her determination, her desire, had taken shape.

Until now, it was just a force raging inside her. She had always used her power to suppress it, to control it, to use it, but now she recognized that it was also herself.

And she would release it.

This ultimate power needed a name.

![break]

---My "power", I give you a name. In order to fulfill the order Rimuru-sama has given, become my strength and release further power. Your name is the Ultimate Skill, "Annihilation King Abaddon"!!---

![break]

Abaddon had the meaning of destroyer. It was also the king of the abyss. A fitting title for Carrera, the "Menace Lord."

Carrera had finally obtained it.

The absolute "power" that could destroy everything.

![break]

---Ultimate Skill 'Annihilation King Abaddon'---

![break]

It was the embodiment of Carrera's desire. A fearsome power that, once unleashed, could bring certain destruction to her adversaries.

Carrera's first desire for power came when she met a powerful enemy. And now that it had come to fruition, the battle between Carrera and Kondou was about to come to an end.


![soft scene break]


*This is no joke*---Kondou thought.

Carrera, whom he had almost killed, had awakened to her ultimate power right before his eyes. From Kondou's point of view, this situation was nothing short of ridiculous. Kondou thought he had struck Carrera with a fatal blow on numerous occasions. And yet, no matter how many times Carrera fell, she kept getting back up.

He had sliced through the barrier with his "Remove" power, and disrupted Carrera's mana circuits with a slash filled with "Necrosis". After steadily accumulating damage in this way, it was the power of "Eraser" that was the final blow.

It should have been over by now. However, even Kondou, who was in full strength, had been unable to defeat Carrera, and now she awakened her power. Kondou was keenly aware of his mistake.

*That's right. If only I had a "Judgment" bullet left...*

This thought may have been due to Kondou's slight weakening.

"Judgment" was a trump card. The most powerful blow that could only be created once a day. However, he had recently used it to weaken Veldora.

It was uncharacteristic of Kondou to beg for something in a life-and-death battle. An enemy so powerful had gained an unknown power. Understanding this, he had fallen to a dark mood. Kondou, however, still tried to muster up the energy. Now that he was clothed in his garments, he would have to fight with an unwavering resolve. Kondou couldn't help but reveal his true feelings to Carrera for the first time.

"You guys are unreasonable."

Humans were ridiculed for being vulnerable, but that was not surprising. The species hierarchy gap between them was so wide that it was too great to be filled. Even Kondou could not help but grumble about it.

Upon hearing this, Carrera nodded in satisfaction.

"Ahhh, of course. We're the strongest species, after all. However, I think you're being unreasonable too, you know?"

It was Carrera's greatest compliment. Carrera had already recognized Kondou as her equal. That was why she respected him to the fullest and challenged him with all her might.

Pointing her sword at Kondou, Carrera prepared herself with no hesitation. She activated her "Annihilation King Abaddon" in her right and left hands, circulating a huge force of power.

The space between Kondou and Carrera overflowed with a stream of black and white light. An enormous amount of magicules was converted into energy, and the aftermath alone was enough to almost blow one away. Carrera controls all of that energy by concentrating her consciousness.

"I'll show you everything I've got."

"...I'd rather you didn't."

"Fufu, don't be such a wet blanket. Now that I've accepted you as an equal, I will show you my best magic!"

Kondou got a bad feeling upon hearing that.

"..."

One who did not care about the circumstances of others---that was the demon named Carrera.

Demon Lord Leon had also suffered for it, but at that time, Carrera had not been serious---she was just amusing herself. Kondou, who had to deal with a serious Carrera, would probably say that Leon had it better.

Of the four "devil lords" including Diablo, Carrera currently had the largest amount of magicules. She had never been able to control them completely, but now that she possessed the "Annihilation King Abaddon", that drawback was gone.

The current Carrera was able to control magic on a level comparable to Velgrynd.

"I'll give you destruction. Now be gone! "Abyss Annihilation"!"

It was the ultimate magic that surpassed even "Gravity Collapse." It was also Carrera's ideal, the most powerful offensive magic.

It was a spell that generated an unimaginable torrent of extreme energy by throwing a substance called up from the abyss into a gravitational collapse force field. It went without saying that it was extremely difficult to control the energy, let alone make it directional.

It was not a spell that should be used on a planet, but Carrera had no hesitation in unleashing it. It was a spell that, if mis-controlled, could wipe out even the planet.

The spell had never been used successfully in the underworld, and this was the first time it had been used in the material world. With no hesitation at all, Carrera used a spell that had never succeeded before.

If Testarossa and the others had been here, they would have stopped Carrera at all costs. But there was no one here who could stop Carrera.

Agera was there, but it would be unreasonable to ask him to stop Carrera. In fact, it might be better to say that it was not Kondou who was the most frightened, but rather Agera, who knew how dangerous the magic was.

And what about Kondou?

He had sensed the danger just by seeing Carrera's preparatory movements and deployed 'Conviction King Sandalphon' even before he heard her announcement. This quick assessment of the situation was what made Kondou, Kondou. However, this time, his opponent was just too much.

'Abyss Annihilation' was an extreme magic that was presupposed upon Carrera's absurd mana to the point of being ridiculous. Its range was vast, and because this wasn't the otherworld, there was no telling how much damage it could do.

Kondou guessed that if they were not careful, it could destroy even the otherworld. If that were to happen, all of the matter in the line of fire of this spell targeting Kondou would disappear. He was aware of this.

If the otherworld was destroyed, Emperor Rudra was likely to be affected as well. Rudra's defenses were sound, but even so, there was still a chance. He had to prevent that from happening.

But that wasn't all. Kondou was aware of a more troubling fact.

Judging from Carrera's stance, even that vicious magic was a decoy. Even if he survived the blow, it would be followed by the main attack of the sword. There was nothing he could do in that case. The only way to survive was to make every sacrifice possible and defeat her here.

Kondou made up his mind. He sheathed his sword and waited for the right moment. Then he moved just as Carrera activated the spell. With all of his might, he drew his sword.

"Yaezakura---Hakkasen..."

He recreated the technique that Hakurou had shown him. The power it contained was the "Judgment" that could only be used once a day. If he was unable to exceed his limits here, Kondou would be doomed. That was why, believing that he could do it, Kondou bet on his own potential. The power of his soul grew brighter.

Would it be Kondou's, or Carrera...?

At the very least, there was no doubt that both of them were giving it their all.

Kondou's blade sliced through the torrent of maniacal energy generated by the Abyss Annihilation.

Carrera's eyes widened, but there was a smile on her face.

Pain shot through Kondou's entire body.

Even the best protection, the mythical-grade ceremonial garments, were unable to prevent the power of destruction. Yet Kondou was not daunted. With conviction, he aimed for Carrera's neck and made the eight flowers bloom.

Carrera, however, was a step above Kondou.

"That's naive. Now then, I will show you my best technique, using Agera's experience as my own!"

Those were her words, but they were more than that.

In a moment of time, Carrera's intention was transmitted to Kondou. A hundred sword flashes that transcended Kondou's sword drew speed.

The name of the technique was the "Oboro: Hyakka Ryouran^[**Oboro** (朧) means haziness/dreaminess, so I like to translate it to Haze (I might be wrong, but I believe this was even used in the anime). **Hyakka Ryouran** is a Japanese idiom that translates to "Countless (or a hundred) Flowers Blooming in Profusion." It's wordy, but I guess if I had to give a translation for the technique, it would be something like *'Haze -- One Hundred Flowers Blooming Madly'*]."

Kondou's sword broke and shattered under the unbearable violence. Immediately afterwards, Carrera's final blow knocked Kondou down to his knees.

.........

......

...

Kondou felt his strength drain from his entire body. He had passed his limit long ago. He closed his eyes and fell on his back. The end of Kondou's life was near.

*I'm halfway there,* he laughed at himself. After all, he had been unable to do anything. Neither able to defend his country, nor keep his promise to Rudra.

![break]

---Be my friend, Tatsuya---

![break]

*Ahhh, I... I was unable to keep my promise to you.* Kondou's heart was filled with regret. The thought of his unfulfilled promise almost tore at his heart.

*"Tatsuya, I have a favor to ask you."*

*"Anything. As your friend, I will do whatever I can to help you."*

That's right, he had wanted to return the favor. He wanted to say thank you to Rudra for calling him a friend, for giving him meaning in this world. Even so, that request was too cruel, wasn't it...?

*"A long time ago, I asked Damrada for a favor. If I lose sight of my ideals, I want you, my friend, to stop me. But I have lived too long. Damrada is too kind to kill me with his own hands. I regret this terrible request I made of him."*

*"That's..."*

*"So, Tatsuya. If it came down to it, would you be able to kill me with your calm judgment? Go and get in Damrada's way, and stop me with your own hands."*

![break]

No, he hadn't liked it at all. Because he wanted Rudra to live, too. Rudra was calm, intelligent, and courageous. He was Kondou's dream, and a hard master to have. He was the man who stopped Kondou from killing himself in this world when he couldn't defend his country. He became his friend. The great champion, Emperor Rudra.

Even so, he had still nodded because he knew Rudra's pain. Rudra's body---his shining 'soul', had long since reached its limit. It was probably the result of repeated reincarnations to control the special power of the Justice King Michael.

Kondou, with his Unique Skill 'Decipherer', understood this fact more deeply than anyone else. Perhaps even more than Velgrynd. She was blinded by her love for Rudra. If she knew what Rudra had asked of Damrada and Kondou, she would have been furious.

In a sense, Rudra's request to Kondou was a natural occurrence. Now that he had acquiesced, he had to keep his promise. Because that was what a promise was. But that time was still far to come. Rudra was still alive and in control of his power.

...But was that really the case?

Looking back, he had felt a small sense of unease. The occasional cold look in Rudra's eyes and his overly cold judgment. Kondou only knew Rudra as such, but he saw that Damrada was in distress. If Rudra was indeed alive and well, why did Damrada need to agonize over it? It was really suspicious when he thought about it.

*Since when?* Since when had Damrada really started to take action?

*Did I perhaps overlook something important?* He had been interfering with Damrada as ordered, but that might have been a big mistake.

Rudra was certainly a shining light when they first met. And yet, Kondou had failed to notice Rudra's deterioration. The moment Kondou realized this fact, he felt his mind begin to clear. It was as if the shackles of his mind had been loosened.

*---I see, so I was long already...at the mercy of Justice King Michael...*

It was shameful, he couldn't help but lament.

That's right. When Damrada was preparing to kill Rudra, he should have taken the lead instead of interfering. Then they could have stopped Rudra.

*What a blunder...* Now, the situation was irreparable. It was unclear as to why Kondou had been freed from the Justice King's control, but he couldn't even move a finger anymore. All he could do now was wait quietly for death.

*I'm so useless. Whether it was sharing your pain or easing your suffering, I have failed to do so. And...even the promise to free you was a failure...*

The task of stopping Rudra did not seem possible by any means.

As it was, he could only reach the end of his life with regret---

.........

......

...

"Hey, don't go sleeping on me. Let's continue the fight!"

As if to disturb his sleep, he heard a voice speaking to him. When he opened his eyes, the enemy he had been fighting to the death with just now was peering at him sullenly.

A demon with shining blond hair and a bewitching smile. Surely a beautiful sight.

*---Don't be absurd. I'm already dying. There's no way I can fight.*

"Huh? But the victor has not been decided. That's no good."

*Heheh. It's not decided, huh? Yeah, sure. After all...you're just so, so unreasonable...*

Kondou chuckled lightly as he heard Carrera's words, though he didn't think she understood him.

Carrera herself was probably already running out of energy and on the verge of death---laughter welled up at just the thought of it. He tried to sit up, and failed. He was a mess.

*After all, I'm not going to be able to do anything more.*

The demon in front of him, on the other hand, was free and pure...

*I envy you, I really do.*

That's what he thought, from the bottom of his heart. It was also why Kondou began to say and do things that didn't even make full sense to himself.

"I have a request. His Majesty, with my gun ...please kill..."

He was going to entrust his role to Carrera, his enemy.

*What am I doing? Making such a foolish wish to the enemy I've been fighting...*

A defeated man's wish was bound to be ridiculed. And yet, for some reason, he said it out loud.

Carrera picked up the Nambu pistol that was lying on the ground.

"This? It's broken."

*So it is*, Kondou thought as his consciousness faded. He had been a little naive to think that maybe the demon would listen to his wish. Demons were not that kind. Reality was cruel, and Kondou understood that very well. His consciousness slowly became more and more distant.

Even though he had become a Saint, a spiritual life form, Kondou was still a human being. If his soul was destroyed, it was impossible to be revived. Carrera's blow had dealt a fatal blow to Kondou. He could actually feel that he was collapsing from the end. It was impossible for him to recover from this stage.

"Hmph. You're just going to give up now that this toy's broken? It's not like you're the one who tormented me. It was such a good fight, but I happened to awaken."

Kondou hadn't expected such encouragement from his former enemy, Carrera. And so, Kondou squeezed the last of his energy and smiled.

"Kukuku, you're right... Hilarious. It's hilarious how pathetic I am... I know..."

After these words, he began to let go of his consciousness.

But---

"Wait, don't die yet. I can kill the emperor if you want or whatever."

*...?*

"You're so slow! What's the reward? It's common knowledge that if you want to work with a demon, you need a contract!"

Carrera was originally a demon that could never be negotiated with. And yet, somehow, she felt as if she could listen to Kondou's request. However, she was not willing to work for free.

Kondou couldn't help but smile at Carrera's flustered expression. He was getting more and more amused. The demon who had been his enemy. Her embarrassed and flustered appearance soothed him.

*I'll give you everything I have---I'll even give you my 'soul', so please.*

His words could no longer be voiced out. Kondou opened his eyes with the last of his strength and looked at Carrera with a strong will.

It was a mockery to believe in a demon. However, with the beauty of Carrera burned into his mind, he made his wish. It may have been Kondou's selfish illusion to think that his message had been conveyed. Nevertheless---he bet on his last hope to save himself from his unworthiness.

The voiceless voice reached Carrera.

"I have heard your wish. In the name of Carrera, the Menace Lord, we have a deal! Your wish shall be granted."

Kondou smiled as he heard those words solemnly proclaimed.

He moved his weak hand with nothing but his will power and pointed it at Carrera. His fingertips touched the gun that Carrera had declared to be broken.

At the touch of Kondou's finger, the Nambu shined golden. It was bathed in Kondou's power, its material changed, and it was reborn as mythical-grade.

Kondou's soul was also passed on to Carrera through the pistol. However, it did not contain his heart.

Carrera knew.

The soul of an enlightened and sinless man could not be set free, even if his soul was bound. He would be released from the wheel of reincarnation without any restrictions and travel to the promised place.

That is, liberation.

Carrera thought it was lonely.

"Hmm, that's no fun. It's been a long time since I've had such a resolute opponent..."

She muttered this to herself, and at the same time---

![break]

<<In that case---Let's combine the Ultimate Skill 'Annihilation King Abaddon' with 'Conviction King Sandalphon'.>>

![break]

Carrera felt as if she heard such a voice. She hurriedly turned her attention to the pistol in her hand.

![full page image](image7)

The pistol glowed with an even greater dazzling golden light, as if it were silently saying, 'Now you won't be lonely anymore.' It was unmistakably a memento of Kondou, and now it was Carrera's new partner.

"Well then... It seems you're with me now."

As she spoke, the pistol seemed to flicker. At the same time, she could feel power flowing into her body.

![break]

---You're using your mana too roughly. I'll help you, so you should use me more skillfully.---

![break]

She felt as if she heard Kondou's voice. In that next moment, she understood everything. In an instant, she had taken possession of Kondou's power.

"Nosy guy. Can you stop treating me like a child?"

The man was such a cocky bastard to the end---Carrera thought so.

She didn't feel lonely anymore.

Carrera stood up.

"Congratulations on your great victory. I, Agera, was impressed."

"Same to you. I'm proud of you for surviving."

"Fufu, it is a pleasure to be praised by Carrera-sama."

Although he was smiling, Agera was wounded. Carrera's mana had poured into his body, and he had been subjected to Kondou's swordplay. Now that he was no longer a sword, he was so badly injured that it was a wonder he had not been destroyed.

Even so, Agera was still smiling with satisfaction.

"This Kondou guy, he was a descendant of your disciple, wasn't he?"

"Apparently so."

"Humans are not so foolish as to be underestimated. They can inherit skills and build upon them to continuously improve."

Agera nodded happily.

"He was stronger than you, though. It's quite something."

Agera frowned in disgust.

"The only reason he was stronger than me was because he was an exception. If we had fought with swords alone, I'm sure I would have won."

"I guess you can say that."

And they both laughed out loud. They were very similar in that they both hated to lose.

As Carrera laughed, she saw a rift in the other world that was collapsing. Through it, she could see Emperor Rudra's seated figure.

"Come now, the battle is not over yet." Carrera walked out with a fearless smile on her face, as she always did.

"Of course, I will accompany you. We will strike fear into the hearts of those who stand in our way!"

Agera followed behind Carrera. He was mortally wounded, but he didn't care.

The enemy was still out there.

And---

Most importantly, the promise must be fulfilled.


![hard scene break]


Granit, the third rank in the Single Digit hierarchy, was a champion who had supported the Empire for a long time. He was a key player who had laid the foundations of the Empire and helped bring about a thousand years of peace.

He was once praised as the "God of War" by the subjects of the Empire, and was a great man as recorded in the history books. Although he had now disappeared from the center stage, he was the chief of the four knights as a confidant of Emperor Rudra.

He was a warrior who had mastered all kinds of weapons and martial arts, and his physique was magnificent. Although he was over 2,000 years old, his black hair which was stroked all the way back and his short black beard gave him a youthful impression.

Confronting Granit was Benimaru, the "Flare Lord".

![break]

The two men faced each other in the center of the circular colosseum.

"I am Granit. Protector of the Empire."

"I am Benimaru. You can think of me as the second-in-command of Demon Lord Rimuru."

After a brief exchange of names, it was time to fight. With that in mind, Granit smiled and spoke to Benimaru.

"Ah, wait a moment. Don't you wish to hear what I have to say?"

"It depends on the content."

"Well, that's simple. I have investigated about you, and it's been reported that you are a very powerful man."

"I'm flattered."

"Fufufu, I'm not trying to flatter you. I've slaughtered many powerful men and I pride myself on my discernment. Even in my eyes, you have passed the test. I'm sure you're no match for any ordinary demon lord."

"What are you trying to say?"

At this point, Benimaru was starting to get annoyed.

It wasn't that he didn't like to negotiate, but now that the battle had heated up to this point, there was no time for a leisurely discussion. If the other side wanted to surrender, that would be a different story, but judging from Granit's behavior, that was not the case. Rather, he seemed to be suggesting that Benimaru surrender.

His prediction was correct.

"I didn't expect you to be so strong. I'm surprised. Kondou was also unhelpful, as the Intelligence Bureau's negligence put our empire at risk. If there are more losses than expected, we won't be able to fight a decisive battle. So, I think we should end this now. Why don't you take an oath to be my subordinate? If you surrender, I will take full responsibility for you and your men."

It was a very self-serving proposal. Since he was about to lose, he was proposing a ceasefire without admitting defeat. From a third party's perspective, it would only have seemed that way. In reality, however, that was not the case. Granit did not believe that he would lose.

Because they had lost a lot of battle power, he was trying to recruit Benimaru and the others in order to replenish his forces.

Benimaru intuitively saw through this and felt even more annoyed.

*This guy...is he trying to use us as pawns? But he seems to have the ability to back up his confidence.*

Benimaru calmly evaluated Granit.

The fact that he made that suggestion in this other world meant that he was aware of the situation inside the other gates. He should have been regarded as a warrior with a tactical perspective, not merely a guard.

Granit's proposal was not even worth considering from Benimaru's point of view.

"So, my subordinates will be fine, but what about Rimuru-sama?"

"It's a shame, but that demon lord is dangerous. We'll need your help to defeat him in order to confirm your loyalty."

Sure enough, Benimaru thought. He wanted them to work together to take down Rimuru, but in reality, he probably just wanted them to kill each other. Of course, if they survived that, they might be willing to let them join, but Benimaru was not stupid enough to trust such an uncertain story.

Most importantly, it was absolutely outrageous to expect that he would betray Rimuru.

"That's not even worth talking about. We would never betray Rimuru-sama."

The only reason why he was still listening to the other party was because Benimaru wanted to buy some time. In fact, he had been hearing someone's voice since a while ago now.

The voice, which sounded both nostalgic and pleasant, came to Benimaru with a proposal.

![break]

<<Benimaru, may I make some changes to the form of power you desire?>>

![break]

Normally, he would never have nodded to such a dubious proposal, but for some reason, Benimaru had agreed.

Although his race had evolved into a "flame spirit oni", Benimaru had not been satisfied with that. Referring to the experience of Rimuru's lending him the Ultimate Skill, he aimed to acquire one on his own.

That goal was half-accomplished.

Upon seeing the battle between Rimuru and Velgrynd, and the struggles of the others, Benimaru had become enlightened.

He integrated the power of fire, his forte, into his Unique Skill 'Generalissimo'.

Although he was unable to recreate Rimuru's power of Absolute Severance, his beloved sword the Red Lotus had been reforged by Kurobee to the level of a mythical-grade sword. If he put black flames on it, he would not be defeated because of the difference in weapon performance.

Generalissimo' was on the verge of reaching the ultimate level, combining the techniques he had developed and the racial characteristics of the 'flame spirit oni' race.

And then he heard that mysterious voice.

Benimaru wanted to see what kind of change would come from his acceptance. That was why he agreed to talk with Granit, but later regretted it when he was told to betray Rimuru.

The mere mention of such a suggestion was offensive.

Having had enough, he drew his sword and held it out towards Granit.

"Hey, come on, it's no good having such a short temper. A monster lives by survival of the fittest. They follow the strong and abandon the weak, right? Isn't it commonplace for monsters to change masters?"

Upon hearing Granit's words, Benimaru became angry enough to feel his head boil.

As a general, he was confident and proud of his calm thinking, but now...

*Heh, I have no right to laugh at Shion like this...*

He mocked himself, but he had no intention of holding back his anger.

"Enough. I have nothing more to say to you."

At those words, Granit shook his head and muttered, 'Good grief.'

"I don't understand. This is a mercy and my greatest concession. I respect your position and am saying that I will hire you as a subordinate without hurting you..."

Granit spoke, seeming genuinely mystified. He had no doubt about his strength. This was because he believed himself to be overwhelmingly stronger than Benimaru.

Understanding this, Benimaru became even more furious. There was only one reason why he had not yet gone off and cut him down. He wanted to make Granit regret what he had said.

"Are you going to continue this conversation lazily just so you can have an excuse for losing?"

"Hahaha, what a joke. I appreciate your spirit, but you should learn to have some self-awareness. Perhaps my men were too proud...and all three of them were defeated. I feel too ashamed to face His Majesty, but as long as you agree, we will have more strength than before. I'll be happy, and you won't have to die. Wouldn't that make for a good relationship? You should understand after hearing that. I have no intention of using you as abandoned pawns."

Obviously aware of Benimaru's annoyance, Granit spoke without shame.

What was even more infuriating was that his words were unmistakably serious. He meant what he was saying. Granit exuded the aura of a champion, and his demeanor eloquently evoked that there was no need for gimmicks.

"If you truly are a general, then think carefully. Your subordinates can be saved with just your heart. Besides, I will tell you the brutal truth. Kondou and Damrada are really strong. Damrada and I go way back, and I am familiar with his character. Well, I'm stronger, but he is also a powerful opponent who will not be defeated even in the face of a primordial. And then there's Kondou. He's a newcomer, but he's just as good as us. It was only because he was too dangerous that he was put under His Majesty's control, but even a primordial cannot defeat him. In other words, in order to challenge His Majesty Rudra, you will have to defeat the four strongest masters, including Velgrynd-sama and myself. You understand that this is impossible, right?"

*This guy is surprisingly loose-lipped*---thought Benimaru. Now that his anger had been quenched a little, he would try to gather some information.

Some of the words were irritating, but if he could find out the inner workings of the empire just by putting up with them, Benimaru had no complaints.

What bothered him was the fact that the emperor had Kondou under his control. There was no doubt that Emperor Rudra possessed some kind of domination Skill.

"It's unfortunate that you've been so vocal and unilaterally determined that we are the losers. Besides, even if we did follow you, it wouldn't be good to be put under control, would it?"

"Kakaka, are you finally interested? I'm sure you are. Well, I had heard that the ogre clan was an excellent mercenary group, so I thought that you would join us depending on the conditions. And rest assured, just as you feared, His Majesty does indeed have the power to control minds. But there's no point in worrying about that."

"..."

"Hmm, so you're not convinced. Well, I guess it would be difficult. Consider it an honor to be dominated. If one is not competent, you'll just be ignored. Besides, Kondou was also dominated, and he was not aware of it. I am the only one who knows, so I do feel a little sorry for him."

"As I thought, you're out of your depth."

It was truly out of the question.

Granit's point as well, was not incomprehensible.

No one would be unhappy because the controlled person would be unaware of it. That was the logic behind it, but no one would nod their head if asked to accept it.

"Is that so? It's true when I say that you don't need to worry. You may not believe much of what I say, but to put it another way, I can assure that you and your subordinates will never be dominated."

"Why not?"

"Because you are weak."

"What a joke..." Benimaru's anger flared up again.

Granit's tone was so natural that it was completely clear that he was not bluffing or anything, and that he wasn't even trying to insult Benimaru. Benimaru was aware that he had evolved to become stronger, so he did not expect to be looked down upon so much.

"Well, just listen. When it comes to being an enemy, you are one of the strongest, but when it comes to being allies, you do not reach the value of being dominated. Not only have we taken control of young Yuuki as well as Kondou, but now we've taken control of Veldora-sama too. I don't think there's enough room to add you to those numbers, so if you swear loyalty to me, you will be allowed to move freely. After all, even if you were to challenge me with all of your subordinates, you would be no match for me."

"That's a lot of confidence. But then again, I am confident in my own strength as well. I don't want to listen to any more arguments, so let's decide who's right and who's wrong with action."

Benimaru readied his sword, which he had slung over his shoulder. He had thought he might be able to get some useful information, but he decided that anything more would only make him more disgusted.

Granit let out a big sigh, not amused.

"Monsters are incorrigible. It's a pity that you are still unable to see the reality of things. It's no use. I guess I have no choice but to give up on trying to win you over and negotiate with the one who defeated Minaza instead."

Benimaru snorted.

"Don't do that. Shion is more stubborn than I am."

Upon hearing this, Granit's face turned serious for the first time.

"Well...? I don't believe you've been introduced, but do you know who Minaza is?"

"Isn't it natural to gather information on the battlefield? Rimuru-sama has also educated us to do so thoroughly."

"Hmm, that's interesting. I wonder how you got the information from the otherworld that Velgrynd-sama created. As I thought, it would be a shame to kill a man of your stature."

With that said, Granit finally drew his sword. He could handle any weapon with skill, but a familiar sword would be more comfortable in his hand.

The moment he held his sword up to Benimaru, Granit's mood changed completely. His previous calm demeanor disappeared entirely, and he radiated a supreme energy that was not unlike a divine oni. His short hair was standing on end, as if he was the embodiment of a man in a furious rage.

"There is a saying in the otherworld, *"ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars."* ^[The quote was basically *"enjaku izukunzo koukoku no kokorozashi wo shiran ya"* which roughly translates to something like *"why would a sparrow know the will/mind of the eagle?"* It's similar to the quote *"ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars"* which I used because it sounds better in English. Basically, it means that the people at the top of the ladder are incomprehensible to those on the bottom, and that's just how nature is.] The meaning is that a small boy cannot understand the thoughts of a grown man, which is exactly what you are. You should have obeyed me while I was gently guiding you."

"Are you still lecturing me at this point? I'm tired of this."

"Hmph! Then die!! Hagun Gekishin Resshou^[Not too sure what this means (I didn't get a good look at the Japanese), but based on MTL it's something like "Army Breaker: Kinetic Shock/Violent Tremor." It's basically an attack with the power of a severe earthquake.]!"

From the first blow, Granit unleashed his most powerful special move. He was confident that this would be the end.

Granit's forte was analyzing the enemy. With the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' lent to him by Rudra, Granit was able to determine the combat capabilities of his opponents. By doing so, Granit was able to correctly grasp Benimaru's strength. That is why he was convinced that there was no way they could be defeated.

Of course, "enemy detection" was not omnipotent. If the adversary had awakened to an Ultimate Skill, it was impossible to know its power. However, it was easy to guess the level of competence just by looking at the amount of magicules the adversary possessed. In this respect, Benimaru and the others were not a threat. Benimaru, Souei, Shion, and the demons. In Granit's eyes, it was obvious that none of them had acquired an Ultimate Skill.

The "primordials" were a nuisance, and it was obvious that negotiations would not be possible with them. That's why he had planned to deal with the demons once they arrived, but it was Benimaru who appeared before Granit.

In Granit's opinion, Benimaru was a promising young man with the potential to awaken an Ultimate Skill, however, he was not a match for Granit. The amount of magicules he possessed was huge, but it was still less than half of Granit's. In that sense, it was natural for him to judge that Benimaru was not a threat.

Besides, Granit was not conceited nor careless. If the enemy was an Ultimate Skill holder, he might have had a hard time depending on the compatibility. As the battle time extended, there was the possibility of the enemy awakening the ultimate power due to perceived danger. That said, it was impossible for the power to suddenly increase just by talking with him.

That is why Granit intended to finish his opponent off with overwhelming power, so that the enemy would not be allowed to fight back at all.

Since Granit knew that Benimaru did not have a 'transformation' like the beastmen, there was no chance for Benimaru to win. Therefore, Granit's victory was certain---

"How lax. You're not doing much for all your boastful talk."

"Wh-What the---?!"

Something unexpected had happened.

The 'Hagun Gekishin Ressho, which contained enough energy to tear Benimaru to pieces, had been deflected by Benimaru's sword.

It was an unbelievable sight.

Granit's entire body was of mythical-grade equipment. Benimaru's sword was also quite good, but it should not have been able to match the strength of the true mythical-grade.

No, even before that---

"N-No way, no, it can't be!! Why...why have you acquired an Ultimate Skill---?!"

It was no wonder Granit was screaming. There was no way the enemy could have suddenly acquired an Ultimate Skill, which had never existed until now.

At Granit's panic, Benimaru's attitude was calm.

"What are you wondering about? A man is one who is constantly growing!"

Although Benimaru seemed fine on the surface, he was covered in cold sweat on the inside.

The moment that Benimaru had received Granit's brutal sword was the moment that he gained power. In that moment, he was able to correctly grasp Granit's power.

If the timing had been even slightly off, Benimaru would have suffered terrible damage. While he might not have died, he was in no condition to laugh about it.

*That was close. I didn't think he was hiding his abilities to this extent... I didn't intend to let my guard down, but I would have lost if I hadn't acquired this power.*

It had been a good thing that he took part in Granit's long conversation---Benimaru thought.

"Well, I guess it's my turn now."

Benimaru switched his mindset and concentrated on the enemy.

As far as results were concerned, it was a good thing that he had survived, but he would reflect on the rest later.

The power he had just acquired was exactly the ideal he had envisioned. That was why Benimaru had performed it with the ease of breathing, and without reserve.

Ultimate Skill 'Heat King Amaterasu'---reflecting the information Ciel had obtained by analyzing Velgrynd's powers, Benimaru displayed this fearsome ultimate power.

Benimaru's sword, the Red Lotus, adorned a black glow. It was a symbol of Benimaru's power---'Amaterasu'.

The word 'Amaterasu' had two meanings in this context.

The first read as 'heat haze' and was understood as a meteorological phenomenon. Extending from there, it became the essence of 'Formhide,' which had no substance, could not be burned, could not be frozen, and could not be cut. The second meaning went without saying. It was the light of the sun, a super-heated flame.

With his swordsmanship added to the characteristics of Amaterasu, even Benimaru could not imagine how much his power would increase.

Granit, being Granit, responded in a manner worthy of the moniker "God of War". After a moment of astonishment, he immediately calmed down and began to search for Benimaru's weakness.

Perhaps it was because he had acquired an Ultimate Skill, but his magicule count was greatly reduced. The amount of magicules had been reduced to a third of Granit's, though it was still enough to make an ordinary demon lord look like a fool.

The unknown power was a threat, but he judged that he could defeat it with a single blow of all his might.

Then he shouted.

"Don't underestimate me, you monster! This time I won't hold back. I'll use all of my strength to defeat you!!"

In the past, Granit's strength had been second only to Velgrynd's in the Imperial Army. In fact, he was stronger than Damrada, and would have been an even match for Kondou. This was still the case today. It was simply that he had not had a chance to be serious. He was not just a guard for Rudra.

Granit then moved to crush Benimaru with all his might.

"Die, Yabugun Gekishin Ressho^[Pretty much the same as before, but instead of 'Army breaker; violent tremor' it's more like an 'Army destroyer.']!!"

It was the same technique as before, but the difference in power was enormous.

A fierce shockwave burst out and lightning flashed in the atmosphere. However, these attacks only passed through Benimaru. No matter the attack, it was not able to touch Amaterasu.

At that moment, a roar sounded in the air. Something had happened, not in this space, but in the otherworld.

*Carrera makes an awful role model.*

In Benimaru's mind, there was a clear picture of what Carrera had done.

Of course, it wasn't through Moss. When he acquired the Ultimate Skill 'Heat King Amaterasu', he was able to see visions of Rimuru and his subordinates connected by the Soul Corridor. As a result, Benimaru had also grasped Carrera's technique.

"I'll show you something special. I've only just seen it myself, but I'll give it a go."

"Wha---"

Granit was unable to react.

This was because Benimaru's attack had already cut him into tiny pieces and burned him to the ground.

Even so, the scariest thing here was Benimaru himself.

His movements were just like a shimmering heat haze. The 'Heat King Amaterasu', which had analyzed Velgrynd's power, also possessed the power of 'Light and Heat Domination' which gave him the ability to accelerate himself. By using this, Benimaru was able to unleash a sword lash of divine speed, though it was not as fast as the Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration.

This invincible technique, which possessed both power and speed, was---

"It's called 'Oboro-Kokuen Hyakka Ryouran^[It's similar to the Oboro---Hyakka Ryouran other than the addition of 'Kokuen' meaning 'black flames.' I translate this as "Haze---Black Flames, One Hundred Flowers Blooming Madly"]'. Well, I guess you can't hear me though." Benimaru said as he turned away with a refreshed look on his face.

Granit was actually quite strong. Moreover, he had been calculating, well prepared, and in perfect condition. Even so, the fact that he had been defeated could be summed up in one phrase---"bad luck." If there was one thing to be reflected upon, it was that he had ignored the strategy of defeating the enemy when you could. Granit had died from talking too much.

Benimaru thought as such and made a mental note to not repeat that mistake himself.


![hard scene break]


Velgrynd was anxious. This was because Rimuru had eaten her 'Split Body.' That Demon Lord Rimuru was one to be feared.

She was unable to communicate with the eaten 'Split Body'. Her thoughts were swallowed up in the abyss, and no response had come back.

Even if she poured her energy into it, it would only be like throwing herself into a bottomless pit. Judging that there was no point to this, Velgrynd bit her lip.

Roughly half of her total energy had been lost with no sign of recovery. It was difficult to maintain her composure, as her belief in the invincibility of 'Parallel Existence' had now been broken.

The current Velgrynd had only about 20 percent of the magicule amount compared to her perfect state. She was finding it impossible to defeat Rimuru and had to make the decision to flee this place immediately.

"Rudra... I can't put him in danger..."

With this in mind, Velgrynd decided to abandon the protection of the gate. Fortunately, no one had attacked yet, so she left without hesitation. If someone interfered with her there, she would just take care of it while there.

Sure enough, she saw a few figures at the location surrounded by the eight gates.

"Oh, what are you in such a hurry for? Have you forgotten something, Velgrynd-sama?"

Testarossa, who appeared to be the leader in the group, asked as she sipped her tea in a relaxed manner.

"...White Primordial Blanc..."

Velgrynd glared at Testarossa whose smile only deepened. As she was in a hurry, Velgrynd was annoyed at the appearance of such a troublesome opponent. In contrast to Velgrynd, Testarossa was smiling gracefully.

"Didn't I ask you to stop calling me that? Or...are you perhaps trying to pick a fight with me?"

Her smile was still there, but her eyes were not happy. In the face of the overwhelmingly dominant Velgrynd, Testarossa remained unrelenting in her stance.

"You still want to fight me even after I hurt you so badly?"

"Yes, it would be a pleasure. I don't need to win. I just need to buy myself some time against you."

Velgrynd's fist came at Testarossa as she stood up. Tables and chairs shattered in the shockwave. Esprit and Zonda had already evacuated to avoid being caught. Testarossa danced around lightly.

The heat was so intense that it could turn one into charcoal just by a mere touch, and the speed was so fast that it was impossible to see. There was no need to dare face the onslaught of Velgrynd with force.

Regardless of skill-level, there was a difference of nearly ten times the amount of magicules between the two. Even though Velgrynd had only about 20 percent of her magicules left, there was still that much of a gap.

And yet, Testarossa maintained a relaxed attitude.

It would be difficult to win. That was because there was simply no way to defeat Velgrynd. But if all she wanted to do was buy time without defeating her, Testarossa's ability would be no problem.

"This is why I hate you guys!!"

"Oh, what a shame. I have the utmost respect for you, sister of Veldora-sama."

"So pretentious. In that case, stop making a scene and get out of my way!"

"I'm afraid I must decline your request. I am a competitive person and I still hate to lose. That's why, I'll get even with you right here!"

This was Testarossa's true intention.

She couldn't defeat Velgrynd in a straight fight, but she could still disrupt her. Even if she couldn't hold out until the other leaders arrived, Rimuru would be arriving soon. At that point, Testarossa's victory would be confirmed.

*Ahhh, Rimuru-sama's victory was truly wonderful---playing the overwhelming Velgrynd-sama as if twisting a baby's hand. I, too, will not be defeated.*

Rimuru had already revealed the details of Velgrynd's techniques, so Testarossa had no intention of letting this opportunity slip away.

Red and white clashed.

One was fierce, the other was graceful.

While weaving a red and white pattern at a frightening speed, they faced each other again without making a single contact.

"How stupid... You're not the same person you were before..."

"That's right. I'm surprised, but I've also acquired an Ultimate Skill. I think it is because of that."

Testarossa answered casually, as if it was nothing. In fact, Testarossa had used the waiting time to hope to gain new powers. As a result, she succeeded in materializing the shape of her own heart. At that moment, she thought she heard a strange voice, but she chalked it up to her imagination. Testarossa was a demon that could choose the right answer by instinct.

As for the power she desired, it was the Ultimate Skill 'Death King Belial,'

Just like the Lustful King Asmodeus of Luminas, it controlled life and death. However, the fact that it weighed more on the side of death must have been reflective of Testarossa's true nature. For her, defeat was a humiliation she could never accept, much less death.

One of the conditions for a demon to evolve was to accumulate power to the limit and then age for more than 2,000 years. It also meant that they could not be defeated even once---in this case, defeat meant annihilation.

The phenomenon of losing one's body and being returned to hell was what was called defeat. So, strictly speaking, a 'draw' did not count as a defeat.

Escape, however, was another matter.

A mental organism was influenced by their own mind. The moment one admitted that they could not beat their opponent and stopped challenging them, they were defeated.

There were some crazy demons in the world, like Diablo, who were truly undefeated, but those were few and far between. Testarossa was aware of only a handful of them.

As long as your heart does not give in, it's okay.

That is why Testarossa did not stop challenging Zegion. As long as she did not stop until she won, it was not a defeat.

The same was true in this case.

Testarossa believed that as long as she didn't run away from Velgrynd, she would eventually win.

"You've acquired an Ultimate Skill, huh?"

"Yes. Diablo's bragging was annoying after all, but it was also because the previous battle made me deeply aware of what I lack. As long as a Skill is a reflection of the heart, they are not necessary---that is what I once thought, but I guess it was a shallow belief."

"..."

"Perhaps it's because I've been able to confront my own desires, but I feel as if I've sharpened my use of power."

Velgrynd also possessed the Ultimate Skill 'Charity King Raguel', so she understood the meaning of Testarossa's words. It was also why she realized that it would be even more difficult for her to withdraw from this place.

"Truly, so abominable..." Testarossa laughed at her unintentional complaint.

"That is the best kind of compliment, is it not?"

And just as Velgrynd's anger was about to reach its peak, there was a massive explosion that distorted space.

Velgrynd, who had regained her senses, looked back in surprise.

One of the gates had been blown apart in a spectacular fashion. The blond-haired demon, Carrera, appeared there. Incidentally, some of Leon's infamy was due to Carrera's actions, but that was not the point right now.

"Hey, it looks like you made it. I don't like losing all the time either, so I'd like to join you."

"Ufufufufu, no, Carrera. I don't mean to be mean, but you're covered in scars."

"That Kondou guy was tough. Well, I'm pretty satisfied, so I think I'll let it go for today."

Laughing, Carrera wobbled, and Esprit rushed over to support her to a chair which Zonda had maneuvered. Agera was also there, but he was left alone.

"If Carrera will put up with it, I'll stop being so selfish. I'm a little tired, so I'll just watch."

Before she knew it, Ultima was sitting next to Carrera. She noticed that Veyron had prepared a chair for her.

One after another, the demons gathered. Of course, it didn't stop there. Shion, Souei, and Benimaru also emerged from their respective gates. Upon seeing this, Velgrynd could only cringe. She realized that the strongest men on her side had all been defeated.

It was a tactical victory for Testarossa.

Rudra and Velgrynd's hopes were about to be crushed.


![hard scene break]


Shifting the viewpoint from the sky to the earth---

On the battlefield, the heat of battle was rapidly dying down. In the midst of all this, Laplace was running towards Kagali, accompanied by Vega.

It appeared that the forbidden spell, 'Birthday', was long over. To be more precise, Kagali must have lost control due to the loss of Velgrynd's assistance.

It wasn't clear how many undead elves had been created, but there should still be some time before they started to move.

Depending on the will of the undead elf, they could become a powerful warrior from birth. That's why it was necessary to take them into custody before anyone else did.

Since Laplace had thought as much, others would naturally come to a similar conclusion. Lieutenant Kondou, who had led the ritual, could not have been unaware of this.

"Damn, I thought I had a head start."

Once Laplace arrived at the site, the Imperial soldiers were in the midst of loading Kagali and the others into military vehicles.

"So, you're Laplace then. I've heard that you're quite strong, so is a fight inevitable?"

The man who called out to Laplace was a gentleman wearing a different colored military uniform. Lieutenant Kondou's white uniform was conspicuous, but this man's bright red uniform gave off a strange air. And yet, he did not look very strong.

He had a doll-like face and was a mysterious man whose gender-neutral looks could be of a man or a woman. He seemed ordinary, and if he wasn't wearing such a flashy military uniform, he wouldn't even have left an impression.

---No, perhaps it was because of the military uniform that the man did not leave an impression. Observing this, Laplace responded cautiously.

"I'm Laplace, and if yer willing to let 'em go, there's no need to fight, right?"

"Huhuhu, that's an impossible proposition. You see, the war is still going on over there. I can't just run away."

The man was determined. In that case, Laplace had no choice but to prepare for battle.

"Then so be it. So who're you?"

It would be a profitable question if answered properly.

"Me? Well, it's only natural that you don't know. I am the tenth in the ranks. I, Feldway, am the one who holds up the history of the empire!"

The man Feldway. He was a permanent fixture in the Empire and was expected to serve as a spare in the unlikely event that there was a vacancy in the Single Digits. He had heard rumors about Laplace as well, but this was the first time he had seen him.

"So, it's you. Then yer the man they call the spare."

"I'm not a man. But I'm not a woman either."

"That's complicated."

Laplace looked at Feldway as they spoke. He looked natural, and not self-conscious. He didn't take a stance, and he didn't appear to be running away. He was an elusive figure.

It was Vega who was impatient.

"Leave it to me. I'll crush that bastard."

Laplace hurriedly stopped him as he tried to move forward.

"Wait a minute, I told you never to run ahead! The Chairman and the others are basically being held hostage, so we can't mess with them."

Footman and Teare were still alive and well, struggling against the masses. If they were called upon, it would be impossible to tell how the battle would turn out.

Laplace cautiously tried to find out what his opponent would do. However, this was interrupted by the appearance of an unexpected person.

"Vega, come help me. Laplace is a traitor. I'll deal with him here."

"---Wha-?!"

Feeling a strong killing intent, Laplace fled from the scene. The voice that reached his ears was that of his trusted boss, Yuuki Kagurazaka. However, what he heard was not what Laplace wanted.

"Boss, come to your senses! It's not like you to be manipulated by others!"

Yuuki had defied Mariabell's control. With his mental strength, he should be able to resist any kind of mental control. However, Laplace's voice did not reach him. Yuuki attacked Laplace with unhindered movements. Seeing this, Vega, who had been confused, smiled a twisted grin of happiness.

"Oh, yeah, boss! When you're done with him, I can eat him, right?"

"Yeah, sure. I welcome you to get stronger."

"You're the boss, you know what you're talking about!"

Following the strong. That's the kind of man Vega was. He lacked morals and ethics. He lived by instinct more than a wild animal. That is why he did not feel his betrayal was evil, and gleefully launched his attack on Laplace.

If it had only been one of Yuuki or Vega, he could have dealt with them. However, dealing with both of them at the same time was a tough task even for Laplace.

*Che, this isn't good. Let alone saving the Chairman, I might get killed. Nope, I'll just have to leave for now...*

From a strategic point of view, Laplace made the correct choice. But that was not going to happen.

"Huhuhu, there's no point in trying to escape. You're Laplace, aren't you? You're cunning and cautious. It would be troublesome to let you go, so I'll have you die here."

True to those words, Laplace's transition failed.

This was the result of Feldway's 'Spatial Domination' of the entire battle area, which he had been observing from up high.

"Damn it!"

Vega shot a turbulent volley of energy bombs in time with a violent kick from Yuuki. Vega may be a muscle head, but he had a good sense of combat. The escape route was blocked, and Laplace's chances of winning were slim. No, rather, as long as Yuuki was there, there was no chance.

*Geez, is this the end for me---?*

Even so, Laplace had no intention of giving up so easily. Betting on the slight possibility that Yuuki's mental domination would be broken, he decided to show the true power he had been hiding.

"Die!"

"You fool! Yer the one who's gonna die!"

In between Yuuki's attacks, he kicked Vega, who had carelessly approached him. This made Vega unable to even stand up for the time being.

"Hey, that's pretty good."

"Yeah. I'm not as good as the boss, but I'm pretty strong too, y'know?"

"I know. So, at the least, I'll kill you with my own hands."

"---Wha?!"

With a small sense of discomfort. Laplace noticed something and hurriedly stared at Yuuki's face.

Sure enough, it was a familiar face... He was caught off guard. Lost in thought, Laplace was too late to react to Yuuki's fist.

*Oh no*---he was screaming in his mind.

And yet...the pain never came.

...Because right before Laplace's eyes, Yuuki's fist had been blocked by someone's hand.

"Kufufufufu. Oh dear, Rimuru-sama has scolded me. That is your fault, isn't it?"

It was Diablo.

*What do you mean by that?---*Laplace couldn't help but want to retort, but he restrained himself from doing so.

"D-Diablo-san. Did you come to save me?"

"Huh? Why would I---uh, that's right. It was Laplace, right? I am here to help you, so make sure you tell Rimuru-sama emphatically that I saved you."

![full page image](image8)

Diablo's expression changed from disgusted to smiling brightly as he said so.

*I've never seen such a suspicious smile before.*

It was quite impressive that Diablo could be seen this way by the admittedly suspicious Laplace, who had a reputation for such smiles. Needless to say, it was not a compliment at all.

"Okay, I get it. I'll tell Rimuru-sama that Diablo-san has been a great help."

"Good! Then I will help you."

In fact, Diablo had just been told by Rimuru, *"What are you still doing here?"* With everyone else working hard, it was only natural that he would be reprimanded as the only one watching Rimuru's battle.

Although Diablo had a good reason for being there to protect Rimuru, he could not say such words to him, who seemed to have completely forgotten his orders. Rimuru was the only one in the world who could swing around the selfish Diablo. This was the moment that proved it once again.

That is why Diablo was ordered to get to work and ran away. After he heard the report from Moss, he rushed to this location. He did not come to help Laplace, but rather to get rid of all the suspicious people.

*Kufufufufu. It was fortunate that I was able to sell a favor to this man here. Now, Rimuru-sama's opinion of me will be restored.*

Diablo felt as if he had already won.

"So, I'll leave Yuuki over there alone because of the alliance...huh? Isn't this the Phantom King? I know you've been coveting this world for a while, but is this the case? You've teamed up with Rudra, haven't you?"

Diablo's gaze rested on Feldway, who had been smiling faintly. The smile faded and he looked at Diablo with a blank expression as he took in his appearance.

"---So then you must be the Black King Noir? Kondou's investigation mentioned that the primordial black had become a servant of the Demon Lord Rimuru, so I see that it's true."

"I now go by the name Diablo. I don't care about what you plan to do, but if you try to interfere with Rimuru-sama, I will not tolerate it. If you are planning to antagonize me, be prepared."

"How kind of you! You are always getting in the way, you damned demon!!"

Feldway glared at Diablo with an intense hatred. His murderous intent alone would have been enough to kill a normal person instantly. However, Diablo was unfazed, and he sneered at Feldway as if to provoke him.

"Never mind then. Even if I were to fight you here, I have no chance of winning."

"Rest assured. It will be impossible to win."

After a brief exchange of glares, Feldway spoke first.

"I think I will retire for the day. If you ever try to interfere with me again, be prepared for that, Diablo."

"Hmm. Well, I'll let you off the hook for remembering my name. But keep in mind, I will prepare the means to kill you."

After those words, they glared at each other again. Then, as if having nothing more to do, they moved on, ignoring one another's presence.

Feldway gave orders to Kagali and Yuuki.

"I'm worried about His Majesty Rudra. We're returning to the flagship, so get ready."

In response, Yuuki, who had been watching over the situation, disengaged from his battle stance. Vega stood up unsteadily and followed Yuuki towards Kagali and the others. Footman and Teare were also called back, and with Feldway's 'Spatial Domination', everyone, including the newly born undead elves, were transferred out of the location. Diablo remained there, communicating with Moss. Now that he knew that the enemy was the Phantom King Feldway, he decided that he was the only one who could fight him. He moved to clean up the mess, albeit reluctantly.

With Footman and Teare retreating, the fight on the battlefield came to an end. After confirming that everyone was safe, he gave appropriate instructions on how to treat the wounded. Moss was not only competent but also in contact with Benimaru. Diablo decided that his work here was done. After Feldway and the others had disappeared, he flew to the flagship by transport.

Laplace was the only one left.

"What, so yer leaving me alone again...?" He muttered to himself and slumped his shoulders.
