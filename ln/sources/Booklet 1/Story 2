# Story 2: Shizue Izawa's|Adventuring Life|Part 1

Several years had passed since the "Hero" took me under her wing. Before I realized it, I had made a name for myself within the Adventurers' Guild. With the "Anti-Magic Mask" inherited from the "Hero," some began to see me as her successor. It was around this time that I earned the title "Conqueror of Flames." I believed all of this was thanks to the "Hero," but she disliked it whenever I expressed my gratitude. She also insisted that I never speak to her formally.

<Just call me Chronoa, without any honorifics. But please, try not to use that name in front of others>, she said, urging me to address her casually. When I asked why, she would deflect the question with nonsensical remarks like, <If anything, I'd rather call you 'Shizu-san.' So, please bear with it.> This became an unspoken agreement between us---Chronoa the "Hero" and I would not delve into this matter further.

We built a strong bond, and I was at the pinnacle of my happiness. Then, one day, Chronoa left on a journey. <I'm sure we'll meet again>, she said, leaving only those words behind. Though I was saddened, I knew I couldn't remain in sorrow forever. Determined to grow stronger, I began expanding my activities beyond national borders.

And so, time went on...

![hard scene break]

Due to an urgent situation, I was summoned to the Adventurers' Guild in the Kingdom of Blumund. As soon as I entered the guild building, I was escorted directly to the reception room, where I found the person I expected---Heinz-san, one of the directors of the Adventurers' Guild.

"Hey there, Shizu-san. Thanks for coming."

"You know I'd rush over from anywhere if you called, Heinz-san. So, what's going on?"

Heinz-san had known me since I was young and had taken care of me quite a bit. It was only natural that I would heed his requests.

He chuckled warmly, just as he had in the old days. "Hahaha, even though you're now a renowned champion, you haven't changed a bit, Shizu-san. But I'm glad. This situation is a bit tricky, and I think it might be too much for you to handle alone. So I've also called my son for help. That idiot hasn't arrived yet, so let me explain the details to you first."

He laughed heartily, but the years had caught up with him---his hair now streaked with white. Seeing this, I couldn't help but feel a bit sentimental, realizing how much time had passed. My own growth and aging had stopped, leaving me looking about sixteen, unchanged. I had grown somewhat indifferent to this, but even Heinz-san wasn't immune to the passage of time. I owed him so much, more than I could ever repay.

*Perhaps I should visit this country more often from now on,* I thought as I listened to Heinz-san's explanation.

The emergency was indeed serious, but it wasn't about monsters attacking. Instead, it concerned a suspicious organization operating in the Kingdom of Grada, the neighboring country to Blumund.

"Could it be devilkin?"

The Kingdom of Grada was smaller than the Kingdom of Blumund, with a population of just under 300,000 and limited territory. Its military strength was weak, and if Calamity-class monsters targeted them, they wouldn't stand a chance.

*Although, naturally, the capital is protected by a Barrier, making it difficult for monsters to infiltrate...*

"Well, that's that. Investigating it is part of the job this time. In other words, we're completely in the dark. Normally, I would have refused such a dangerous request..."

Heinz-san's concern was understandable. While adventurers were often seen as expendable, that didn't mean their lives should be wasted unnecessarily. No one wanted a pointless death. Ideally, thorough investigations would be conducted beforehand, but in this case, there was no time for that. Moreover, it seemed to involve trouble in a neighboring country.

Adventurers didn't belong to any specific country, so borders didn't matter to them. However, sending a large number of adventurers intervening could be problematic. Whether that country would accept them was another matter altogether. In this case, it all depended on how the Kingdom of Grada would respond. The decision to allow adventurers in for an investigation would rest with the higher authorities in Grada.

"As you know, the Kingdom of Grada does not border the Great Forest of Jura. It lies between our country and the great nation of Farmus. That's why they have relatively few adventurers, and we received the request for assistance here."

"Maybe the Kingdom of Grada has nothing to do with it."

If Grada was involved, it would make things easier. If they requested assistance, we could cooperate with confidence, knowing the rewards would be assured. However, if there was no official involvement, we might not receive any support at all. In the worst case, they could even deny us entry. The cooperative relationship between the state and the Adventurers' Guild varied from country to country. I always thought this needed improvement, but the reality was that things often didn't go smoothly.

"It's probably close to the worst-case scenario you're thinking of, Shizu-san."

"Does that mean...?"

"Yeah. The Kingdom of Grada seems to dislike outside intervention, so they probably won't tolerate adventurers acting freely within their borders," Heinz-san said, sighing heavily. Instead of receiving national support, we were facing the possibility of outright obstruction. It was clear that even the guild was at a loss in this situation. The fact that Heinz-san called me despite such difficulties suggested there must be a very compelling reason behind it.

"The client is from the guild in the Kingdom of Grada, aren't they? So how did their request reach here?"

It must have been through transmission magic or a messenger. In this world, there were no convenient devices like telephones, so magical communication was often used for emergencies. However, relying on that alone could make it difficult to convey the severity and specifics of a situation. For this reason, in urgent cases, messengers known as "foot couriers" were often employed to deliver messages swiftly.

Foot couriers were individuals who could use magic to reduce fatigue and enhance their leg strength. While they might not be particularly strong in combat, they could run faster than most monsters. If the message came from a neighboring country, they should have arrived in less than two days. And I received the message exactly two days ago.

"Sharp as ever, Shizu-san. Being trained by a hero certainly paid off!"

"Don't tease me."

"Sorry, sorry. The magical transmission came two days ago. If that had been all, I was planning to reject the request, but they also mentioned sending a foot courier at the same time. That gave me a bad feeling, so I hurriedly contacted you. It seemed urgent, like something we needed to be ready for."

If calling me had turned out to be unnecessary, it would have affected the guild's credibility. Even if I didn't mind, Heinz-san would, being the serious person he was. And his hunch was right---when the messenger finally arrived, it became clear that this request couldn't be ignored.

"So, I guess it's good that my visit wasn't wasted? We can't refuse the request now, right?"

"Yeah. The messenger who arrived was Alfred Grada, the third prince of the Kingdom of Grada."

I was momentarily speechless. A prince acting as a messenger? I had never heard of anything so outlandish. It wasn't impossible, but in that case, there should have been a large entourage, including bodyguards.

*I don't think it's possible for him to cover this distance in two days, but he actually has arrived?*

"Is he really the prince?"

"No doubt about it. He had a royal-issued ID, using the magical medium also employed for contracts. So, he was definitely the real deal. And it turns out, Prince Alfred himself is the client for this request."

No wonder we couldn't refuse. But this sounded like a rather troublesome situation, especially since the client was a prince, yet cooperation from the Kingdom of Grada wasn't forthcoming.

"Understood. Well then, tell me the details," I prompted Heinz-san to continue, but before he could, a fierce presence approached outside the reception room, and the door suddenly swung open.

"Wait a minute, old man! This is an internal issue of the Kingdom of Grada. Just because the client is a prince doesn't mean we should get involved!" A young man who closely resembled Heinz-san burst into the room. It had to be Heinz-san's son, Fuze-kun.

When Fuze-kun was a little kid, I used to carry him around, though he didn't seem to remember. I had heard he had been on a warrior's journey recently, traveling through the western countries to train. It was good to see he was doing well. He was slightly shorter than me, but his strong presence was undeniable. It seemed like he had grown quite skilled, which made me happy for him.

As I was reflecting on this, a parent-child quarrel erupted right before my eyes.

"Shut up, Fuze! Sure, it's an issue of the Kingdom of Grada, but that doesn't mean it has nothing to do with us! Also, even with soundproofing magic, we shouldn't be discussing such matters so loudly. Sit down. Or are you scared? If you are, then I won't rely on you. Just leave now!"

"What did you say? That I'm scared? Hah, you think that woman over there is more reliable than me? She was celebrated as a champion over twenty years ago. Her glory days are long gone, and now she's just coasting on her reputation. To rely on someone like that---"

"I told you to shut up!"

Heinz-san, who had risen from his chair, swiftly moved and punched Fuze-kun. His actions revealed his experience as a seasoned adventurer. Even after stepping back from the front lines, his move was truly impressive.

"Pweh, that hurt, you know! I thought an old man like you wouldn't pack a punch, but that actually stung. But you know what, I've been through my fair share of battles too. I'm tired of being seen as less capable than my old man forever."

"Tch, you're getting cheeky. Well, whatever. If you're going to talk big like that, I'll involve you in this case. Come in and sit down."

"I'll allow that, but what about her?"

"This case could be managed without you, but Shizu-san is absolutely necessary. From what I know, she's the strongest person after the 'Hero.'"

"Damn it, you're saying she's better than me? Whatever. I'll prove my strength surpasses yours in this matter," Fuze-kun glared at me and plopped down heavily onto the sofa---for some reason, right next to me. So, I didn't think he actually disliked me...

*Maybe it's just a rebellious phase? Perhaps boys his age should be lively like this.*

To me, who didn't have children, Fuze-kun seemed quite adorable.

![hard scene break]

Heinz-san also took a seat, and the discussion resumed. The option to refuse this request had vanished now. I hadn't intended to refuse, but if I did, I worried Fuze-kun might do something reckless. If it came to that, I felt it would be more reassuring to keep a close watch myself.

"---Well, let me fill you in on the specifics."

Although it seemed Fuze-kun had eavesdropped on us using a skill, we started over from the beginning. Information gathering was important, but even more crucial was information sharing. Adventurers knew that assumptions were the most dangerous thing to carry.

Just as Heinz-san was about to begin explaining, the door swung open once again. The faint presence suggested whoever it was, they were quite skilled.

"I'll handle that explanation."

"Prince Alfred---?!"

"Quiet. Here, I'd prefer you to call me Al," Prince Alfred---who entered---said and smiled gently, keeping Heinz-san in check.

As he said, I would call him Al, "As you said, Al-san, please explain."

"Hey, hey, who would actually call him that?"

"Hahaha, as expected of the famous 'Conqueror of Flames.' I appreciate that you get straight to the point."

"...That's right. Either way, it's not good to use real names here. My prince---no, I shall call you Al. Fuze, you should read the room too."

"Tch, I get it."

Surprisingly, Fuze-kun agreed. He seemed to have a good sense of judgment, and with more experience, he was likely to grow into a great adventurer.

"So, Al, are you sure you don't need to rest?"

"No problem. I got a good two hours of sleep, after all."

"Then let me introduce these people first. You might already know them, but just to be thorough." With that, Heinz-san introduced me and Fuze-kun to Al-san.

"This is the maximum force we can mobilize. If we move with a large group, the enemy will likely catch on, so a small, elite team would be best, right?"

"I appreciate it. Relying on you, Heinz-dono, was the right decision."

"Hmph! The moment you came here alone, I could pretty much figure out the situation. So, what's the current status?"

"Yes, let me explain from the beginning. You probably have many questions, but please listen to what I have to say first."

It seemed we were finally about to get a detailed explanation. We had received a rough overview earlier, but now that Al-san was here in person, we would likely get a more thorough account of the situation. We needed to form a plan based on this information, and it was crucial that the plan's success rate was as high as possible. Refusing wasn't an option, so it was my job to maximize our chances of success.

With that in mind, I listened carefully to Al-san's story. While the situation wasn't the absolute worst, it was far from optimistic. Here's what became clear:

There was a suspicious organization operating in the Kingdom of Grada, apparently based in a church. This organization, for some reason, possessed vast amounts of wealth, which they used to bribe nobles within the kingdom. As a result, instead of the expected first prince, the much-maligned second prince had come closer to the position of crown prince. Up to this point, it might seem like a domestic issue, and from the perspective of other nations, it was just an internal squabble. Sure, succession disputes in royal families were problematic, but given the Kingdom of Grada's small size, it was expected that it wouldn't attract much attention from other countries. However, the real issue was not the family disputes but the behind-the-scenes manipulation. The devilkin I was initially worried about were not involved. While that was a relief, the current adversary was potentially even more malicious.

"Does the name Echidna ring a bell?"

We fell silent at Al-san's words. The organization---Echidna---was notorious as an underworld force from the Eastern Empire. They were said to have anywhere from tens of thousands to even millions of members, making them a threat that small countries couldn't handle. Not only in the Kingdom of Grada but also in the Kingdom of Blumund, safety was not guaranteed if targeted by Echidna. Fortunately, Blumund was a member of the Council of West. In an emergency, it would be possible to appeal to the Council for support against Echidna. But...

"You serious? The Kingdom of Grada isn't a member of the Council, right?"

"I see. So the Empire plans to use the Kingdom of Grada as a foothold to begin conquering the western countries."

"That's right. My elder brother, Reinhardt, was investigating the financial sources of my second older brother Edward's faction. He suspected Echidna's involvement. The church they are based in was in opposition to the Western Holy Church. They constantly insulted each other's gods and were always at odds. Echidna cleverly exploited this rivalry and absorbed the church. In the Kingdom of Grada, the state religion has been worshiping Jilzaridhara for generations. By controlling that church, it became easier for them to connect with the nobility. By the time we realized it, it was already too late."

The state religion of the Kingdom of Grada was a native belief in a deity called Jilzaridhara. While some followed Luminism, the majority adhered to Jilzaridharism, with a ratio of about three to seven. This was one reason why the nation's membership in the Council had been delayed. From Echidna's perspective, Grada must have seemed like very convenient prey.

"But who would've thought they'd bare their fangs at the nation itself..."

"The problem ain't that. Assuming that story is true. Echidna is backing that fella Edward to take over the Kingdom of Grada, right? This might already be beyond our control, ain't it?"

It might sound rude to say this, but Fuze-kun seemed quicker on the uptake than I'd initially given him credit for. If he was going to back out here, I was going to say no, too. This was no longer a problem for adventurers to handle. While devilkin were enemies of humanity, Echidna was part of humanity itself---albeit a shady part.

"Indeed, it's hard to argue with that. However, there's a compelling reason we can't ignore them! They view our people as mere experimental subjects. If they were just exploiting us as livestock, we might endure it. But they're planning to use our people as sacrifices to resurrect the great deity Jilzaridhara! This is wickedness that cannot be overlooked!"

Indigenous gods varied greatly, and not all of them were benevolent. Even malevolent powerful spirits could---depending on the circumstances---be worshiped as gods. Likely, the deity Jilzaridhara also had a symbiotic relationship with humanity, harboring its own negative aspects. This speculation was confirmed by Al-san's reaction.

"Who's that..."

It seemed Heinz-san wasn't fully briefed on this detail. His concern was clearly directed toward managing Echidna's executives.

"If we fail, does that mean this Jil-whatever god will be resurrected? With many victims sacrificed?"

"Jilzaridhara is a powerful deity, but whenever one asks for favors, it always demands sacrifices. Traditionally, a thousand sacrifices were required. While it was useful in times of war, it's unnecessary in today's world. However, since it's also conceivable that vicious monsters and beasts may descend from the sky, it's an unsplittable heroic god for us."

The god worshiped in the Kingdom of Grada, now dormant, would not care who provided the sacrifices, as long as it received them.

"So, if Echidna provides the sacrifices..."

"That's right. Jilzaridhara would be harnessed by Echidna."

That was the worst-case scenario. It was clear now that the internal issues of the Kingdom of Grada could not be ignored. Remaining on the sidelines was no longer an option.

"I have no choice but to do it."

"Hey, hey, Shizu-san. Who are you planning to kill?"

I didn't mean it quite like that, but Heinz-san's interpretation wasn't entirely off.

"The members of Echidna and anyone who gets in our way."

"Don't simplify it like that! Weren't you listening? Do you realize how many enemies we're up against?!"

I didn't know the exact number, but not everyone would attack simultaneously, and some might not be suited for battle. Overthinking it wasn't necessary; things would work out somehow. Besides...victory wasn't solely about numbers but about the quality of strength. If the opponent was unbeatable, even one enemy could make victory impossible.

"Everyone, I am well aware of the dangers involved in this mission. Certainly, within my country, we recognize the importance of this matter and have mobilized the knights to counter Edward's forces. Our plan is to capture the executives of Echidna before they awaken Jilzaridhara. At present, Reinhardt is devising a strategy prioritizing this objective above all else. My task was not only to enlist adventurers within the country but also to seek support from external sources. Most likely, the greatest obstacle will be defeating the executives of Echidna."

The Kingdom of Grada appeared to be doing what was necessary, countering numbers with numbers and quality with quality, focusing on securing personnel capable of opposing the strong. Their caution was warranted because their opponents included Echidna's executives.

"Can you win against an executive, Al-san?"

In my estimation, Al-san was quite skilled. Even I found him to be an expert whose presence was hard to read, and judging by his gait, he seemed to be a highly skilled swordsman. If even someone like him was cautious, then we must consider the enemy to be quite formidable.

"If the opponent were alone, I might stand a chance. However, that man, Ash, has two bodyguards---a double-blade user and an assassin---alongside him. He himself seems to be a powerful magician, adept at summoning and elemental magic. Honestly, I judged it too tough for me alone. So, I've requested reinforcements from neighboring allied countries."

Apparently, that man named Ash was an executive of Echidna. It seemed that spies from the Kingdom of Grada investigated, but several of them were killed by assassins. I was grateful for their valuable information and offered prayers for the souls of those who had passed away. Also, Al held the position of the Third Prince and Captain of the Knights. Although he had requested cooperation from adventurers this time, he said they wanted to resolve the incident themselves if possible. However, they had discovered the presence of formidable enemies that knights alone might not be able to defeat. So he hastily contacted various places to check if there were any renowned adventurers staying there. And that was how they chose me and Fuze-kun for this.

"I guess if I hadn't contacted Shizu-san, it would have turned into a huge problem..."

"I'm grateful for your decision, Heinz-dono. No matter how many less skilled individuals we gather, they wouldn't stand a chance against multiple strong opponents."

Of course, it wouldn't be meaningless. Humans would tire, so if you surrounded them with enough people, eventually you could win. But doing so would result in an unknown number of casualties. Moreover, if the numbers were lacking, defeat was also possible. As a reliable method, the best course of action was to gather those who could compete against the strong.

"I think you did the right thing, Al-san. You were polite enough to ask, but you wanted to seek our help, didn't you?"

"Yes. While it is due to our country's incompetence, leaving this matter unresolved could cause trouble for the western neighboring countries as well. Swallowing my pride, I humbly ask you. Please, come with me," Al-san said and bowed his head. I thought his gesture of bowing his head and casting aside his status as a prince of the kingdom was sincere.

"Yeah, I understand. Well then, shall we head out right away?"

"Hey, hold on, hold on! How about my answer---wait, even before that, I mean, we haven't even prepared anything yet!"

"I'm ready anytime!"

"I am too. Shizu-dono, I owe you my utmost gratitude!"

"Can we discuss that after the mission is completed?"

It looked like Al-san was ready to depart at any time as well. Then we should quickly depart for the Kingdom of Grada.

"I said wait! I get it. I'm coming too, so at least give me an hour!"

Saying he needed to prepare, Fuze-kun hurriedly left the reception room. I smiled when I saw him like that and thought about how restless Fuze-kun was.

![hard scene break]

The three of us ran at a good pace toward the Kingdom of Grada. This method was faster than using horses. Al-san mentioned that he had reached the Kingdom of Blumund in less than two days. Should this be expected of him as a knight commander, or was he particularly impressive despite being a prince? At the very least, he seemed to have more stamina than Fuze-kun.

"Haa, haa, wait, wait a moment, let me rest. Just a little bit..."

I chuckled and said, "Come on, you've got to be kidding to whine like that. We've only been running for about twenty hours, you know?" But Fuze-kun turned bright red and shouted back at me. "Dumbass! I'm not kidding!"

And just like that, he fell to the ground.

"Eh, you weren't kidding?"

"Of course not! We haven't even eaten yet!"

"Eh? If you're hungry, you'll eat what you've brought for yourself, no...?"

"No one does that! Why would anyone eat while running?"

Strange. I had made Fuze-kun angry. It appeared that there was a bit of a difference in adventurer's common sense between me and Fuze-kun.

"Seems like a problem. How about taking a short break then? Al-san, are you okay with that?"

Turning to Al-san, I saw him also panting and sinking to the ground.

"A-apologies. But, Shizu-dono. A-at this pace, we might be too exhausted to move once we reach our destination..."

"Is that so? We haven't even been sprinting at full speed yet, so we should be fin---"

"Break! Let's take a break!"

If that was what the client said, then I had no choice but to comply.

"Got it. Then, how about ten minutes, give or take?"

"Hey..."

"N-no, it's quite a fast pace already. We should reach Grada from here in less than half a day. It's more convenient to arrive at night, and for a proper rest, let's take a solid ten-hour break to rest our bodies. Fortunately, there's a water source nearby, and under that large tree, we'll be fine even if it rains."

And so it was decided. If we could take it this easy, I'd like to treat myself to something delicious while we were at it. So, I started cooking. I took out a pot and---

"Hold on. Where did you take that out from?"

Just as I thought Fuze-kun had collapsed for good, he came back to life and now looked at my hands, complaining.

*Where did I get this pot from, you say? Well, that's obvious.*

"This? I gathered iron sand and Altered it. Handy, isn't it?"

"Handy is one word for it...whatever. So, what are you making?"

Somehow, it seemed I ended up preparing Fuze-kun's meal too. It was a rule for everyone to prepare their own meals, but I had also been taught cooking by Chronoa. To my surprise, Chronoa knew about "Japan." I had tried recreating Japanese cuisine, and most attempts were failures, but there was a successful one. And it was this.

"It's pork miso soup. Even with ingredients that were dried and carried for a while, I can bring them back to a fresh state."

With my ability---the unique skill Deviant---changing the state of ingredients was my specialty. I had extracted moisture to reduce volume, making them easier to carry. Inside my backpack, it was packed with these processed ingredients. Even the pork was aged to its most delicious state.

"Will you eat too, Al-san?"

"Absolutely!"

With that, I quickly got back to cooking.

"Hey, isn't your power a unique skill? Is it okay to use it for something like this?"

"Of course it is. Even the 'Hero' praised me, saying, 'You should think of more ways to utilize it!'"

"Oh, I see. Well, if that's the case then..."

I was glad Fuze-kun agreed.

"Here it is, all done! Here you go!"

I Altered a wooden branch into improvised bowls, poured the pork miso soup into them, and handed them over to the two.

"O-oh."

"I humbly receive this meal."

The two initially received the bowls nervously, but their faces lit up with smiles when they smelled the aroma. They began eating the pork miso soup with gusto.

"Hot! But delicious!"

"This is wonderful. It's an unusual taste, but really delicious."

It seemed making the soup was worth it, given their positive reactions.

"There's plenty for seconds, so eat as much as you like!"

I really wanted some onigiri too, but I couldn't afford to be extravagant. We filled our stomachs with pork miso soup that day.

![hard scene break]

With our stomachs full, we decided to take a bath after a post-meal break. If there was no time, I would have made do with the everyday magic spell Clean Wash, but psychologically, I wouldn't feel truly clean. Since we had some time, I decided to heat up a bath and clean myself up. I would also wash my clothes. I was used to these tasks due to frequent travels.

"No, no, who takes a bath in the middle of a journey? Do you have no common sense?"

"It's not just water; it's hot water."

"That's not the issue here! Wait, how will you manage to heat the water--- Oh, right, you could easily do that."

It seemed like Fuze-kun knew that I commanded Ifrit. Indeed, boiling water was quite simple for me. I casually cast a fireball near the water source. I melted the stone to create a glass-like substance to seal it and prevent leaks. With the bathtub prepared, I used a pot to fetch water and filled it up. I dipped my hand into the water to adjust the temperature. In no time at all, the bath was heated.

"You're going to get in too, right? How should we take turns?"

"You are being too careless! With two men here, a woman should not be getting undressed!"

"Eh? I mean, I'm not going to be naked. I'm wearing underwear and a mask. Besides, with three of us here, we can watch out for monsters, right?"

Since we were traveling, we should stay vigilant against monsters no matter the situation. That was obvious for adventurers. That was why I always wore underwear when taking a bath, exercising caution. Of course, that was my intention this time as well. Well, with two strong men keeping watch, I didn't think we had to worry about monster attacks.

"That ain't the point at all!"

For some reason, Fuze-kun kept complaining until the end, but eventually, he relented and took a bath.

"Just leave your clothes here; I'll wash them together later."

"Are you my mom or something?!"

It seemed that Fuze-kun was in a rebellious phase. In the end, he let me handle the laundry but firmly refused to let me wash his underwear. It was a missed opportunity to change or even wash them... Personally, I'd recommend taking a proper bath and doing the laundry. Al-san also seemed dissatisfied along with Fuze-kun, but after taking a bath, he looked quite content. As expected, a bath felt great. I took my turn last, then took care of the laundry and cleaning up. I made sure to dry the washed clothes properly and handed them back to the two.

"T-thanks."

"Thank you. However, experiencing such comfort on a journey is beyond what I'd normally expect. Baths are not something that even inns have at the ready..."

I had my complaints about that too. In this world, oddly enough, there were fewer inns with baths. Even if they existed, you typically had to fetch the water yourself and bathe outside the inn or pay an additional fee for hot water.

Chronoa used to complain about this as well.

<I'm so grateful to have you around, Shizu>, she always praised me during bath time.

The next day, I woke up feeling refreshed. Fully replenished, we departed in high spirits.

![hard scene break]

We arrived at our destination ahead of schedule, in less than ten hours. Taking enough rest seemed to have paid off. With this, we should be able to make up for any minor delays.

"Actually, it's not like we're in such dire straits that a two or three-day delay would make a difference. We don't have the luxury to take it easy, but we still have plenty of time to prepare adequately. Even for Echidna, which has strong organizational capabilities, preparing over a thousand sacrifices won't be easy. More importantly, about the method of infiltrating the capital---"

Normally, even citizens of the Kingdom of Grada needed to go through procedures to enter the capital city. Especially for adventurers not affiliated with the state, strict inspection was required. This inspection could take several days in some cases, but it was unavoidable. Accepting individuals with strength surpassing monsters on their own was out of the question.

In any case, now was not the time to be discussing such leisurely matters. Moreover, there was no guarantee that the second prince's people wouldn't be at the reception, so we planned to enter the capital without going through reception. That was precisely why arriving at night was preferable.

The current time was around the end of dinner, after eight o'clock. Since we arrived a bit earlier than planned, we decided to discuss our future plans now that we were nearing the capital.

"The outer walls of the capital are a little over four meters high. We shouldn't have much difficulty jumping over them, but doing so might trigger magical alarms and set off alerts. Therefore, we'll wait for a specific time and then proceed with our infiltration."

That specific time referred to the changeover of the magic personnel. Needless to say, it was a state secret.

"Hey, hey, is it really okay to know that? Won't they kill us later for knowing this?"

Mhm, mhm.

It seemed like Fuze-kun noticed that too. Judging by his sharp awareness, it seemed Heinz-san's education was thorough.

"Your concern is valid, but please trust me on this. We'll review this rotation after we're done with this matter."

"Do that."

With that reassurance, we moved on to the next step.

"Once we're inside the capital, security isn't as strict. However, both factions stagger their patrols, so let's stay vigilant and not let our guard down."

"Of course."

"You don't have to tell me."

"Yes, you're right. My apologies."

Al-san likely already thought it was going to be fine. Even so, by emphasizing it, it was clear that he had a meticulous personality.

Then, Al-san continued with his explanation. First and foremost, we would prioritize meeting up with our allies. Our allies were the first prince's faction located in the royal castle. We would head to a hideout out of sight, then use the royal family's secret passage to sneak into the royal castle unnoticed.

"For real, though, if we know that, aren't our lives in serious danger?"

"It's natural to think that. However, this decision is unavoidable for now. There are other secret passages besides this route, so we will consider abandoning it afterward..."

Al-san said with a grim expression, emphasizing that trusting him was the only option. It would be better to eliminate anyone who knew the royal family's secrets to prevent future problems. It seemed Al-san himself was thinking that there would inevitably be someone who thought that way. But the fact that he was making us aware of it already made me feel like we could trust him.

"Fuze-kun, let's trust Al-san here. If we can't trust our comrade, any strategy is bound to fail."

When I said that, Fuze-kun let out a deep sigh.

"Can't be helped. If you say so, I'll trust my life to Prince Alfred. You have my trust, Al-san," Fuze-kun said, making Al-san smile wryly.

"Haha, I guess I can only say 'leave it to me.' Above all, betraying your expectations would be the hardest thing for me. It's only been a few days, but I'm honored to be considered your comrade, Shizu-dono. So please, trust me until the end."

With those words, Al-san's gaze was unwaveringly sincere, and both Fuze-kun and I decided to believe in his words.
