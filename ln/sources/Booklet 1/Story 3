# Story 3: Shizue Izawa's|Adventuring Life|Part 2

The time had come, and the infiltration operation was carried out.

As planned, we swiftly arrived at the hideout and made our way safely to the royal castle. We were then escorted to the reception room, where we were introduced to several key figures.

The well-built man with an impressive beard was this country's first prince, His Highness Reinhardt. Alongside him were the prime minister and the vice captain of the knights. There was also another man who looked exactly like Al-san. This man was the head of the spies of the Kingdom of Grada. For the past few days, he had been publicly acting as Al-san's double. His disguise techniques were so skillful that it was impossible to tell them apart when they stood side by side. Of course, in combat, their differences would become obvious. These individuals were the key players involved in this operation.

"Welcome, Shizue Izawa-dono, the 'Conqueror of Flames,' and Fuze-dono, the 'Gale Swordsman.' Your exploits are well known in our country. It is truly reassuring to have you on our side." His Imperial Highness Prince Reinhardt welcomed us on behalf of everyone.

Next, Prime Minister-san spoke. "First, allow me to apologize. It is a great disappointment to our nation that we couldn't assemble a sufficient number of personnel within the limited time for this mission. Unfortunately, the situation is less favorable than we had hoped." He then began explaining the current situation.

Echidna's activities had intensified, and preparations for the revival of the god were progressing steadily. If the goal was to make the second prince the crown prince, it would be naive to simply appoint the first prince as the successor. Such an action would likely plunge the Kingdom of Grada into civil war.

Although information was tightly controlled, it seemed the current king's health was deteriorating. Reportedly, two-thirds of the nobility in the country had already declared their support for the second prince. If the king were to pass away under these circumstances, a civil war would almost certainly break out, regardless of what else happened.

*If this were merely a matter of succession, I'd recommend leaving it alone...*

But if the second prince were to ascend to the throne, the revival of Jilzaridhara would become a real threat, leading to catastrophic consequences. To prevent such a scenario, it seemed there was no choice but to cooperate.

"So, is this god called Jilzaridhara really likely to be revived?" I asked.

The Prime Minister's face twisted with bitterness at my question.

"Our country's cathedral is a historic and revered structure. It can accommodate over a thousand people and is designed with steps so the altar is visible from anywhere. However, it also contains certain mechanisms used for a specific ritual..."

Apparently, the backs of the chairs had hidden mechanisms---stakes aimed at the heart and blades for the neck---that could spring out. The altar at the center was positioned at the lowest level. In other words, seated believers could be killed, and their blood would flow down to the altar.

"That's quite an elaborate design..."

"I don't deny it. However, this ritual is believed to bring our prayers directly to God. Those who were dying volunteered for the ritual, convinced they were journeying to God's realm."

"I can't agree with that, but now isn't the time for that discussion. So, what about the answer to my question?"

The crucial issue was whether Jilzaridhara would indeed be revived. If the sacrifices had already been gathered in the church, we would have to plan our strategy with the assumption that the revival was imminent. In that case, our chances of success would drop drastically. However, if there were no sacrifices, we could quickly seize control of the church and eliminate Echidna's executives.

Since dealing with the second prince was beyond our jurisdiction, we should leave that matter to the people of this country.

"You can rest assured on that front. There shouldn't be enough sacrifices for the revival of the god. We have our people monitoring closely, and the number of individuals entering and leaving the church hasn't exceeded a hundred at most."

The head of the spies answered in place of Prime Minister-san.

*That's a relief, then.*

"So, our mission is to take down Echidna's executives---is that correct?"

"That's the request. I'll manage things at the castle to ensure the nobles don't interfere. Forgive me for leaving you with such a dangerous task."

Upon hearing His Highness Reinhardt's words, Fuze-kun and I nodded in agreement.

It was unthinkable for a royal, especially one being considered for the throne, to participate in a raid operation. It would be more beneficial if he focused on restraining the nobles allied with the second prince's faction.

"The knights will be fully mobilized to confront Edward's forces and Echidna. The three of us will proceed as planned to eliminate Ash and his group. Does that sound acceptable?"

At Al-san's statement, the vice captain appeared apologetic. Given the circumstances, there was no choice but to leave such formidable enemies to Al-san, which likely made the vice captain feel inadequate. But this was something that couldn't be helped. In this world, no matter how many weak people there were, they couldn't defeat the strong.

"Yeah, leave it to us. So, who's taking on whom?"

Our targets were the enemy leader, Ash the Magician, along with a dual-blade user and an assassin.

As Fuze-kun pointed out, we needed to decide who would face whom.

"I'll take on the dual-blade user. Despite my appearance, my swordsmanship is decent. I'd like to ask Fuze-dono to handle the assassin. While I'm not sure about endurance, the 'Gale Swordsman' surely has better burst speed than I do, right?"

"That makes sense. Since you're an elementalist, it'll be easier for you to take on the magician, right?"

Hmm, I think Fuze-kun might be misunderstanding something.

Personally, it didn't matter to me whether I was facing the swordsman, the assassin, or anyone else. Master Claude trained me to counter any opponent, and Chronoa drilled me thoroughly in unorthodox techniques.

Looking back, despite being the great "Hero," Chronoa had an unexpectedly cautious side. Coupled with her immense abilities, it was easy to understand why she was considered the strongest.

I should take a cue from her and work harder to become stronger myself.

"Got it. So, we'll defeat our own targets first, then assist the others as needed. Sounds good?" I proposed.

Al-san and Fuze-kun nodded in agreement.

"Hmm, as expected. Such impressive confidence," Al-san remarked.

"Is that a challenge? Fine by me. I'll prove that you're a champion of the past," Fuze-kun retorted, still seeming to doubt my abilities.

I sighed, realizing that merely running long distances wouldn't convince him of my strength, but there was no helping it.

"Fuze-kun, you worry too much. I won't lose to younger folks, so rest assured---"

"Tch, it's not about that!" he snapped, raising his voice.

It seemed Fuze-kun was embarrassed. He was probably concerned because he thought my strength was declining. Ever since I assimilated with Ifrit, I hadn't felt any physical decline. I tended to forget, but I wasn't much younger than Heinz-san, who was about to retire. I might be younger than Fuze-kun's mother, but from his perspective as a young person, we probably seemed similar in age.

"Thank you for worrying about me. But I'll be fine. I'll make sure not to let my guard down."

Indeed, it was essential not to let your guard down. And if, despite that vigilance, I still lost to the enemy, it would simply mean I couldn't win, no matter how hard I tried. In other words, it would mean I was weak, and I would have to accept that fact rather than regret it.

"Heh, I see. Well, don't worry. No matter how much you struggle, I'll quickly handle things and lend you a hand," Fuze-kun replied with a grin.

"I wouldn't want you to forget about me either," Al-san added, echoing Fuze-kun's sentiment with a smile.

They were reliable people.

"Agreed. Let's do our best so we can all return safely," I said.

And with that, the plan was set. Now, all that remained was the execution date, but everyone seemed exhausted from the past few days of sleepless nights. Even if we went to bed now, there was a sense that executing the plan the next day would be tough.

"We will also prepare ourselves. During that time, please rest as much as you can," Prime Minister-san suggested.

We decided to accept his proposal. As a result, the execution date was set for the early morning two days later.

![soft scene break]

Ash, one of Echidna's executives, sat across from Edward, the second prince of the Kingdom of Grada, his smile deepening. He swirled the wine in his glass, savoring its rich aroma, and let the liquid roll over his tongue.

His mind raced with memories of the hardships he had endured until now. Over a decade of Echidna's covert operations flashed through his mind---establishing roots in this land, earning trust. All of it was to gain control of this country. No, that wasn't quite it. The true objective was...

"So, when will I be able to seize the throne?" Edward's nervous voice tactlessly interrupted Ash's reverie.

Suppressing his irritation, Ash maintained his smile and replied to Edward.

"The operation is proceeding smoothly, thanks to Your Highness's support. Please continue to assist us. Now, regarding Your Highness's coronation..."

Ash paused, his expression twisting as if something troubling had come to mind.

"What is it? Speak quickly," Edward demanded, his irritation growing.

Waiting for just the right moment, Ash resumed speaking.

"Understood. I've received a report from my spy in the palace indicating troubling activity among the First Prince's faction."

"My brother, huh? An eyesore of a man, but he's just resisting the inevitable. He still doesn't understand the current situation."

"That's correct, Your Highness. If your brother were to bow his head and submit to you, we would gladly welcome him into our ranks. However, since he remains hostile, we cannot afford to overlook him."

"So, what is my brother up to?"

"It seems he intends to seek support from other countries. A messenger has already been sent out."

Upon hearing that, Edward chuckled dismissively.

"Support? Ridiculous. What kind of fool would involve themselves in another country's succession disputes? Blumund lacks the strength to bring our country under its sway. And as for Farmus, they have no reason to absorb our country. For them, where Luminism is the state religion, merging with our country, which has many non-believers, would likely be more trouble than it's worth."

Edward's judgment was correct.

The Kingdom of Grada was an unattractive nation for others to send reinforcements to---but that was about to change.

If Edward became king, he would establish connections with the Eastern Empire through Echidna. Until now, those efforts had been obstructed by the powerful nation of Farmus, but with his ascension, they would be able to trade more freely. Of course, to achieve that, new trade routes would need to be opened, and he had already devised a viable plan for this purpose.

By relying on the great power of the god Jilzaridhara, Edward could even impose demands on the great nation of Farmus. To achieve these ambitions, the necessary sacrifices were to be made by purchasing slaves from Echidna.

"Father and even my brother lack ambition! What's wrong with a king desiring to expand his realm?!" Edward declared boldly.

A life spent in the shadow of an exceptional older brother, unnoticed and unacknowledged by anyone. This frustration festered in Edward's heart, growing larger with the delusions that Ash had so carefully nurtured.

Edward was now nothing more than Ash's puppet, though he remained completely unaware of it.

While secretly mocking Edward, Ash skillfully manipulated him on the surface. Although Edward had become obedient to Ash, his higher status meant that causing his displeasure could jeopardize Ash's future plans. Therefore, Ash carefully chose his words when dealing with him.

"I thought they were being careless, but it seems their goal isn't to influence other countries."

"What?" Edward asked, intrigued.

"They seem intent on hiring famous adventurers to target us. It's like they don't know their place, or rather, they're being foolish."

"Haha...hahaha! How foolish. Adventurers? What can vermin like them possibly do? Even if they bring a few of those trash along, it's just a matter of disposing of them as usual. My brother really lacks any significant intelligence, doesn't he?"

"Fufufu, exactly. Leave it to me to take care of that," Ash replied with a smirk.

What Ash failed to account for was that Alfred was a cautious man and that the chief spy loyal to the royal family was a master of disguise. These two factors led to him overlooking Alfred's departure from the country as a messenger. This proved to be a fatal oversight, allowing Shizue Izawa, a powerful ally of Reinhardt's faction, to intervene.

Unaware of this, Ash dismissed the possibility that a few skilled individuals could cause any real problems and didn't reconsider his plans. However, he didn't forget to take precautions, just in case. It was this vigilance that had elevated a man like Ash to a position among Echidna's executives.

Edward casually nodded toward Ash and said, "Yeah, do as you please. So, how's Alfred? Still not willing to follow me?"

"It's a deadlock, I'm afraid. Alfred-sama dislikes sibling rivalry and has joined the knights to maintain a neutral stance. However, the knights swear loyalty to the royal family. If His Majesty the King were to designate the Crown Prince as his successor---"

Even if this were whispered in private and not openly stated, it could still be enough to push Alfred to support Reinhardt. Although it had not been confirmed, Ash couldn't completely rule out the possibility of such a move. He worried that this issue might become a concern.

And indeed, within the royal palace, the situation was unfolding exactly as Ash had feared.

"That is unlikely. Father is merely waiting for his death at this point. Surely he understands the consequences of making a foolish move at this stage, without anyone needing to tell him."

"Indeed. However, even if Alfred-sama were to side with the Crown Prince, we have gathered enough forces to handle it. It would lead to civil war, but I would ask for your forgiveness in that case."

"...There's no helping it. If that time comes, Alfred will become a cornerstone of this country. But truth be told, I don't wish to burn down the capital of this kingdom, which is destined to be mine, with my own hands."

At that moment, neither of them doubted that their ambitions would be fulfilled. The operation was nearing its climax, and whether it was the king's death or the completion of the preparations that would come first, they held the reins of control.

That was why they didn't anticipate the enemy making a move first. If that happened, a civil war would erupt in the small country. In a sense, they trusted the enemy to avoid such a foolish choice, believing in the sensibility of the Crown Prince.

And then, the next day, they would come to realize their miscalculation.

![soft scene break]

The knights, concealed in the darkness of night, were stationed at various points around the town. At sunrise, they began their operation, evacuating the awakened citizens from the designated battleground areas.

A hundred knights, one-third of the order, were involved in this operation. Another hundred were stationed at the royal palace under Prince Reinhardt's command, tasked with arresting nobles who sided with Prince Edward. Meanwhile, we were set to storm the cathedral with an elite hundred knights. The signal for the start of the operation had just been given.

"Charge!"

At Al-san's command, everyone surged forward all at once.

"E-enemy attack!"

The enemy was not foolish. Upon hearing the sentry's shout, their counterattack unit sprang into action.

This was the beginning of a civil war, but the enemy likely had only a few of the country's own forces. They probably had reinforcements from the massive organization known as Echidna.

The battlefield was the cathedral. Although we were told the enemy numbered less than a hundred, we couldn't afford to be careless. The cathedral was their stronghold, and we had no idea what traps might be set there.

Even now, several knights fell simultaneously. Stakes shot out from the chairs, piercing the legs and sides of the passing knights. I had heard these were traps designed for harvesting sacrificial lives, but I hadn't realized they could be used in this manner. Although most of the knights were protected by their armor, a stake to the neck could be fatal.

"Don't let your guard down! Magic squad, hit the enemy with fireballs and clear the obstacles!"

In response to Al-san's command, the sorcerers of the knight order launched fireballs.

Roaring explosions and blazing flames engulfed the cathedral. Hidden enemy soldiers emerged from the chaos.

The melee began. Swords clashed, and shouts of anger filled the air. The raging flames were quickly subdued by the intensity of the battle on both sides.

Ignoring the tumult around us, we charged straight through the cathedral.

Knights who had finished evacuating the citizens would surround the area around the cathedral. We couldn't allow the ringleaders to escape; if they got outside, those knights would have to deal with them, which could escalate the damage. Now was not the time to worry about the chaos within.

"I'll leave the rest to you!"

Al-san entrusted the scene to the vice captain and followed us. As planned, we headed towards the altar, where we suspected the target was hiding behind a door.

Then, a figure appeared on the altar.

"Alfred, I am disappointed in you!"

The voice came from someone who closely resembled Al-san. This person was likely Prince Edward.

Though Prince Edward was reputed to excel in strategy, he seemed lacking in combat skills. Despite his lower threat level, he still needed to be apprehended as the mastermind behind this civil war.

"My, my. Just as the plan was about to succeed, there's this unanticipated interference. I never imagined you'd deceive us and ally with the first prince. Still, I must commend your caution," the pompous robed man said, addressing Al-san.

This man must be Ash, one of Echidna's executives.

The eyes visible behind the robe seemed slimy and unpleasant, almost snake-like in nature. I felt uneasy about judging someone based solely on intuition, but Ash definitely gave off a villainous aura.

"You know, I don't just memorize the faces and names of my subordinates, but also their hobbies and preferences. I speak to those on duty every day and watch for anything unusual. That's how I noticed when one of my subordinates began acting strangely and realized something was wrong."

"So, you figured out our involvement then?"

"Exactly. I didn't like their methods and judged they weren't fit to be on our side."

"Ku-ku-ku, how cheeky."

"Brother! I have something to say to you as well!"

"What is it?"

"I ask that you sever ties with such suspicious individuals and surrender. You can then appeal directly to Father and Brother Reinhardt---"

"You fool. Your naivety is truly unfit for royalty! Now that things have escalated this far, someone must take responsibility. Even if I were to surrender, I wouldn't escape the death penalty. So, unless you stand by me, reconciliation is out of the question!"

"Kuh, then there's no choice. With this sword, let me show you and make you come to your senses!"

Negotiations had collapsed. This was an expected outcome.

And so, we found ourselves plunged into battle without further ado.

![hard scene break]

Perhaps they underestimated me, as an assassin attacked from the shadows. However, their movements were completely exposed by my Magic Perception. With composure, I dodged the knife thrust and kicked the assassin toward Fuze-kun.

"It's a common tactic to target those who seem weaker, but for some reason, I just can't forgive you right now."

Next, a dual-sword wielder charged at me, but Al-san intervened. "I shall be your opponent."

Prince Edward, maintaining his dignified posture, chose to step back and observe from a distance. Whether he had the ability to sense danger or was simply uncomfortable with rough situations, his retreat was understandable. Well, since it didn't matter if he lived or not, his safety was not a concern.

I decided to focus on my own opponent.

Confronting the enemy leader, I noticed that Ash, unlike a typical magician, wore a fearless smile.

"What's the matter? Surprised to see me unprotected and unchanting? From what I gather, you're a swordsman. May I ask your name?"

"Shizue Izawa."

"Shizue Izawa... Shizue, you say?! I can't believe I have the honor of meeting the renowned champion."

It seemed Ash was familiar with my name. His previously relaxed demeanor shifted to one of visible caution.

"Have you decided to surrender obediently?"

If he chose to surrender, I personally had no intention of taking his life. Given the gravity of his offenses---which seemed to amount to subversion---a death penalty seemed inevitable, but he might be given a chance to reflect on his actions before the sentence was carried out.

However, Ash scoffed at my words. "Foolish. If I were to accept that proposal and get caught, there might be a chance for a plea bargain. But if all I need to do is survive, there's a simpler and surer way. And that is to kill all of you!"

In response to Ash's declaration, three individuals clad in robes attacked me from behind.

These weren't Ash's guards that Al-san and Fuze-kun were fighting; they seemed to be newcomers not mentioned in the intel. It was surprising that all three were quite small in stature, but their movements were formidable and couldn't be ignored.

I calmly evaded and positioned myself to handle all four opponents, including Ash. The three seemed tougher than anticipated. With Ash's offensive magic added to the mix, even I would struggle. I needed to resolve this quickly or risk being overwhelmed.

Seemingly sensing my anxiety, Ash burst into laughter. "You shouldn't underestimate those three, 'Conqueror of Flames.' They might be failures, but they serve well enough as my meat shields. Now, go all out and finish off that woman!"

The latter part of his statement was directed at the three individuals. In response to Ash's command, the three discarded their robes and attacked with renewed speed. However, there was something even more surprising. Those three were actually children.

"---Children?"

"That's right. But don't underestimate them. They're just like you, after all."

*Just like me?*

I was deeply curious about what that meant. Ash's earlier mention of "failures" only heightened my anxiety.

"---me."

"Eh?"

One of the three, a girl who approached me directly, murmured something. When I instinctively asked her to clarify, this time there was a clear plea.

"Kill me!"

Upon hearing that desperate cry, I involuntarily froze. A searing pain shot through my side. Seizing the moment of my vulnerability, the other two children moved in.

"Hahahaha! So the rumors of your soft-heartedness were true. It seems there's an unexpected advantage in dealing with a pushover like you, even for these failures."

Ash's laughter was sickening. The pain in my side was nothing compared to how irritating his mockery was.

"I'm sorry. I-I didn't want to do this---"

The child who had stabbed me was crying, his voice trembling.

"No, I hate this! This is just, just awful..."

"We can't disobey orders. So please, kill us."

"We're not going to live long anyway. I heard failures like us who couldn't gain power don't get to live long."

"So please don't worry about it," the children pleaded.

Even as they spoke, their actions didn't cease. Their physical abilities were impressive, surpassing those of Al-san and Fuze-kun, but their movements lacked the finesse of trained combatants. They relied on raw strength and coordination rather than technique. Initially, I was taken aback, but their technique was no match for me.

The children continued to cry as they fought. Ash, meanwhile, cast strengthening magic on them and scolded them harshly. "Hurry up and finish her off! You worthless shits!"

The situation was unpleasant, but I chose to ignore him for now.

There was no falsehood in the children's words. They were simply being manipulated by Ash. And as I observed them, I couldn't shake a troubling suspicion about these children.

"Summoning technique---?"

"Kukuku, you've figured it out. That's right. Those brats are just like you, weapons summoned from 'another world.' They have the drawback of breaking down easily, but they're quite useful in their own way."

"Could this technique possibly be...?"

"Hm? Yes, that's correct." Ash sneered with an ugly smirk. "You're just like them, aren't you? Summoned as a weapon, Champion-dono?" Ash added and laughed out loud. "Gyahahaha!"

It was sickening. But right now---

The children were being pushed beyond their limits by Ash's orders. They had already surpassed the effects of the strengthening magic and their physical limits. Now, their internal magicule levels were rising uncontrollably, pushing them into a state of rampage. Their bodies were beginning to break down, and once it reached this point, even recovery magic wouldn't be able to help them. Saving them was no longer an option---

"What's wrong, Champion! Can't do a thing? That's right. Those brats have been enhanced by my magic to be stronger than even high-ranking majins. For a has-been like you, all that's left is to run and hide!"

Despite Ash's taunts, I ignored him and focused on the children. All I could do was one thing.

"I shall grant your wish."

Apologizing silently in my heart, I wrapped my sword in flames. It was the only way I could free them from their suffering, the best I could do for them at that moment.

I swung my sword.

"Thank you."

Again.

"You have my gratitude."

And once more.

"Don't cry. We won't have to suffer anymore---"

I held my sword up in front of Ash. Sentimentality would have to wait until it was all over. That was the golden rule for survival and common sense for adventurers.

"Th-this is absurd..."

"You have angered me."

*I will never forgive you.* I glared at Ash with that intent.

![hard scene break]

Even behind my mask, I couldn't conceal my intent to kill. Ash sensed my anger and briefly showed a hint of fear, but he quickly regained his composure and smirked again.

"Excellent. I'll give you credit for that, 'Conqueror of Flames.' Your skill is impressive beyond what I heard, but it doesn't change my advantage."

What Ash was basing his confidence on was unclear, but it seemed he still had an ace up his sleeve. But it didn't matter. No matter what he had, I would not forgive him.

"Hey, Ash! Are you going to be okay? If you lose, what will happen to me?!"

Realizing the tide was turning against him, Prince Edward started to complain to Ash. Although it seemed disrespectful to speak of royalty this way, his demeanor was quite undignified. Yet, what Ash did next was truly appalling, even to me.

"My, my, I didn't expect to be pushed this far, but having Your Highness here has been quite helpful."

"Hm? Hmm, well I suppose so. As long as I'm here, the knights can handle anyth---huh?"

Ash, who had approached the unsuspecting Prince Edward, suddenly stabbed him in the chest with a knife he had discreetly drawn.

"W-what are you---Guhaaa!"

On the altar, Prince Edward staggered and fell. His blood flowed, streaming down onto the altar. No, not just His Highness's blood, but also the blood of those who had died in the cathedral, mingled and flowed into the altar.

"Hmph! Only the royal family of this country can become vessels for Jilzaridhara. It was wise to take this fool in, just in case."

With those words, Ash kicked the fallen Prince Edward.

"Kha-how dare you bketray---"

With tears of frustration staining his face, Prince Edward murmured his final words. Pitiable, but it was what he had brought upon himself.

"Ha-ha-ha! Now, Jilzaridhara! I've prepared a body for you. Awaken from your slumber and heed my words!"

It seemed Ash intended to command a god. I didn't think he could pull off such a stunt, but I had no intention of standing by and watching silently.

"Relying on uncontrollable immense power will only lead to unfortunate outcomes."

Yes---just like how I ended up killing Pirino.

"Nonsense. It claims to be a god, but it's merely a monster bound by mutual interest! Research shows it obeys any command if provided with sacrifices. And with enough sacrifices to awaken, there's no need to pay in full upfront. First, I shall offer you to Jilzaridhara! Gyahaha!"

As if to prove Ash's words, the body of the presumed deceased Prince Edward began to twitch and pulse.

---And thus, the god awakened.

<Did you call for me?>

At this point, there was barely any trace of Prince Edward left, not even his face. His physique had expanded and morphed into something demonically muscular. From that body, an immense youki was emitted, hinting at a power far greater than the combined strength of the children from earlier. He was the real deal. Of all the foes I'd encountered thus far, none had been as strong as this entity called Jilzaridhara. Yet, I did not feel afraid. Because I knew of an entity stronger than Jilzaridhara.

"Oh, God! Hear my plea. In exchange, I offer the lives of all present here unto thee!"

<Very well. I shall hear your plea.>

Ash, who had been prostrating himself after hearing the god's response, now twisted his face in delight and turned towards me.

"Your end is here! Will you grovel before a god in a pitiful plea? It's futile! Thrash about in disgrace and entertain me. Watching a strong one being trampled is the greatest amusement, no matter how many times I see it!"

With his twisted desire unabashedly revealed, Ash continued to laugh raucously.

It was sickening.

Ash's laughter was grating and offensive.

*Enough---I will not endure this any longer.*

If the children's blood was used to resurrect a god, I would burn away that life completely. After all, I didn't think those children ever wished for the resurrection of a god.

I wouldn't let even a god disturb those children's peaceful rest.

"Shi-Shizu-dono! This is getting dangerous. We can't handle a god!"

"He's right. Let's retreat for now and regroup with the others at the royal castle---"

They might have defeated their respective opponents since Al-san and Fuze-kun came over to my side. They witnessed the godly Jilzaridhara and seemed to realize what was happening. They hurried to bring me back, but my resolve had already been set.

Above all else, I was furious from the depths of my heart.

"I will stay here and defeat that thing. You all should escape first and help the survivors."

"Hah? What are you saying at a time like thi---"

"Fuze, obey my words."

"Wha?!"

*Sorry for being disrespectful, okay?* But for a disobedient child, this was the most effective approach.

"Let's go, Fuze-dono. Let's leave this to Shizu-dono."

"Y-yeah. Sh-Shizu-san, you won't die, right?"

*Who knows, I can't promise that.* However, to reassure Fuze-kun, I removed my mask and gave him a comforting smile.

"...!"

"I'll do my best not to die. So, please take care of this---it's something important."

"I-I understand."

Fuze-kun took the mask from my hand and cradled it carefully against his chest. Then, prompted by Al-san, he moved away from the scene.

"Hahahaha! There's no escape. Now that the god has revived, all of you will be slaughtered!"

"Is that so? Then why aren't you running away?"

"Huh? Why would I need to run aw---guagh!"

Ah, as I thought. Ash was swiftly dispatched.

When negotiating with a superior entity, it was crucial to choose your words with utmost caution. Supernatural entities often twist our words to suit their own convenience. Ash's earlier words were practically a request to be killed, so this outcome was completely expected.

*I wanted to eliminate the man named Ash myself, but I let you, who claims to be a god, handle it this time. So, Jilzaridhara-san, I want you to receive my anger.*

"Wake up---Ifrit---"

Flames enveloped my body. The power that had been restrained by the mask was now unleashed.

<What, a spirit? How dare a feeble higher spirit like you interfere with a god!>

Jilzaridhara launched a punch toward me, brimming with destructive power. However, I remained unfazed.

The flames surrounding my body consumed each and every cell, converting them into pure energy. The burns had transformed into patterns resembling flames, spreading across my entire body beneath my clothes. This was evidence of my Harmonization with Ifrit.

Just as Jilzaridhara's punch was about to make contact, my body distorted and vanished like a mirage.

<What?! Is this... Harmonization with a spirit? No, it can't be--->

For a supposed god, he seemed quite surprised.

Even though I was Shizu now, I was not merely that existence alone. I had fully assimilated with the Raging Flame Giant, becoming the "Conqueror of Flames."

I had always lived while suppressing Ifrit's power, but now, I was releasing all of it. Burning with this anger, I sought even greater power. I sensed Ifrit's momentary confusion, but it quickly vanished, replaced by a sense of jubilation.

Perfect harmony---feeling this good, I might even thank Jilzaridhara for it. But I had no intention of forgiving.

I raised my sword and declared, "You spread misfortune. There's no need for a god like you."

There was no such thing as god in this world. If there were, they should have granted my wish.

<Silence! How dare a lower being like you speak words denying a god!>

Indeed, this was no true god. Then, there was no need for restraint. I would use all my strength to eradicate this so-called god, a source of misfortune. Resolved to fight, I transformed into the embodiment of fire and launched my assault on Jilzaridhara---

![soft scene break]

That battle was nothing short of absurd. Hiding behind debris from the collapsed ceiling, Fuze and Alfred observed Shizu closely.

"W-wow..."

"I never expected Shizu-dono to be so incredibly strong..."

Both of them were rendered speechless and completely captivated by the battle.

No, One could say they were completely enthralled by Shizu's beauty. The moment Fuze saw her true face, he was struck with a shock as if his heart had been pierced. A delicate, ephemeral, gentle, fair-skinned, and ethereal beauty. Despite being close to his mother's age, Shizu appeared as a young girl, still youthful. That was Shizu, the woman in question.

Fuze didn't remember, but apparently, he had been held by her when he was young. Heinz, Fuze's father, told him that he used to bury his face in Shizu's chest and be overjoyed, often teasing him about it. Embarrassed by this, Fuze had acted rebelliously towards Shizu...

*Damn it, I'm such a fool! Why can't I remember that sensation!* With these self-directed complaints, Fuze's heart was filled with regret.

He then recalled his attitude towards Shizu, cursing his actions while thinking to himself, "baka, baka, baka, baka," reflecting on his behavior.

"How beautiful. From Fuze-dono's attitude, I had assumed she was much older."

"No, you're not wrong, but maybe she doesn't age at all. In the 'other world,' it seems there are people with such unique constitutions."

"Hmm, is that so?"

"Probably."

Fuze and Alfred found themselves more engrossed in discussing Shizu's story than the outcome of the battle, which would decide their own fates. In a way, they were both true to their instincts.

As they watched, the battle reached its climax. Jilzaridhara's fierce attacks assaulted Shizu, but she perfectly anticipated and skillfully countered every one of them. No matter how powerful the attacks were, they were meaningless if they didn't connect. Shizu's masterful maneuvering was a lesson in itself.

Moreover, although Shizu's attacks weren't one-hit kills, they steadily wore down Jilzaridhara's stamina. Having just awakened, with their power not fully restored and not yet fully attuned to their vessel, Jilzaridhara couldn't consider Shizu a weak opponent.

<Impossible, to think that just by absorbing the power of a higher spirit--->

"You're mistaken. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't have been able to unleash this much power."

As Shizu spoke, her sword inflicted a small wound on Jilzaridhara. Flames burst forth from the wound, spreading the damage wider and wider.

<Annoying, insolent! But, I don't understand. Against my attributes, flames should hold no superiority whatsoever. And yet, what is this?!>

The current situation was extremely undesirable for Jilzaridhara. They had been injured by an opponent they had tried to crush like a mere insect. Moreover, it seemed that against an opponent they thought they could easily defeat, they were now being pushed back. Jilzaridhara still had enough discernment to realize this.

"Oh, you're a god, and you didn't notice? I used my power to change your attribute. It didn't completely take away your superiority, but it successfully neutralized your advantage."

Shizu dropped this bombshell on the increasingly anxious Jilzaridhara. She had changed the attribute of a god to allow her fire to pass through. Shizu certainly claimed that.

<Impossible! There's no way you could pull off such a stunt!>

Jilzaridhara roared in outrage, shouting, "Don't joke around!"

While Jilzaridhara claimed to be a god, they were not a true 'god' in the literal sense. Their true identity was that of a fallen angel who had transformed into a monster, gaining power surpassing even that of run-of-the-mill demon lords. Even archdemons, considered to be among the strongest demons, would be nothing more than fodder to Jilzaridhara. Whether they had just been resurrected or not, the situation remained the same.

Moreover---demons were strong against angels, angels were strong against spirits, and spirits were strong against demons. For Jilzaridhara, a former angel, an elementalist was supposed to be no enemy at all. That was supposed to be the case...

He was not a true god, but neither was he someone who would lose to the likes of Ifrit. Besides, the flames of a spirit shouldn't have any effect. However, now Shizu's fire was scorching Jilzaridhara's body.

<Did you really change my attribute---?>

"That's what I said, didn't I? Even though you claim to be a god, you can't distinguish truth from lies. I see through you. You're a fake."

Shizu now completely understood Jilzaridhara's power. When she used her unique skill, Deviant, to Alter Jilzaridhara's attributes and make her flame power effective, she realized that Jilzaridhara had the attributes of an angel. Although Jilzaridhara's stored magicules far exceeded Shizu's, she understood that their Level was lower. That was why Shizu felt confident she could secure victory by continuing her steady assault.

<Don't underestimate me!>

"That should be my line."

Dodging Jilzaridhara's wild, anger-fueled punch, Shizu swiftly slashed with her sword. The blade gleamed red, severing Jilzaridhara's arm.

<Ugh?!>

Jilzaridhara's eyes widened in astonishment.

It was only then that they realized they were being driven into a corner.

"Are you ready? If you're a god, then show me you can withstand this attack."

<N-no, stop!>

"I won't forgive you. You've angered me."

<You're mistaken! It wasn't I who angered you, but that puny human.>

"No, you're wrong. If it weren't for you, this disaster wouldn't have happened."

Thinking those words were unreasonable, Jilzaridhara felt a human-like emotion, though it seemed unlikely to sway Shizu. At that moment, the tables had completely turned.

<Wait! It was the humans who were using my power! From now on, I will reduce the number of sacrifices. So--->

"If only you had used that power for good, you could have alleviated some of the suffering. You may regret it in the afterlife."

<Wait--->

"---Inferno Flame---"

Without further argument, Shizu unleashed her refined magic power on Jilzaridhara. In that moment, Jilzaridhara's body Altered as if guided by flames, burning away to ashes. Thus, Jilzaridhara vanished from this world without a chance to resist.

Fuze and Alfred witnessed the entire sequence of events. They then muttered their thoughts quietly.

"That was insane. From now on, I've got to make sure never to anger Shizu-san."

"I agree."

"But man, we didn't get our moment, did we?"

"Yeah. I was ready to shield Shizu-dono with my own body if needed, but I never got the chance."

They looked at each other and sighed in unison. However, with Shizu's victory, the battle came to an end. The crisis had passed. Remembering this, both of them began to show expressions of relief and joy.

News of Shizu's victory spread outside, and the cathedral was soon filled with cheers.

![soft scene break]

When I defeated Jilzaridhara, the battle outside had also reached its conclusion.

Fuze-kun ran up to me and handed me the mask, then filled me in on the situation outside. Alfred joined in the explanation, informing me that the operation had been successful.

At the moment Prince Edward was killed, the morale of the Second Prince faction plummeted. Once Ash fell, members of the Echidna attempted to flee, but those who tried were either captured or killed by the knights waiting outside. It seemed none managed to escape.

"Thank you, Shizu-dono! Truly, you are a champion and the savior of our kingdom," expressed Prince Reinhardt, conveying his gratitude.

With the king's condition stable, it seemed that the Kingdom of Grada would soon return to its usual calm.

My role in this kingdom had come to an end.

.........

......

...

It was quite hectic for about a week, with ceremonies and welcoming feasts. Although I was told they were preparing a grand reward for me, I didn't particularly want it. Instead, I requested a respectful memorial for the children who sacrificed themselves and for those who lost their lives in the turmoil. It might be just a small gesture, but I thought it was better than doing nothing at all.

Now, I needed to change my mindset. I couldn't stay in this country forever.

Through this incident, I became interested in the organization Ash belonged to---Echidna. How did Echidna gather "otherworlders"? Ash had referred to the children as failures, implying there were others who had been summoned as well. Summoning from another world wasn't easy. If they managed to summon multiple "otherworlders," it was crucial to investigate how they did it.

Moreover, it seemed Ash knew I had been summoned by Demon Lord Leon.

What that meant was...

There was a possible connection between Ash, or rather the organization he belonged to, Echidna, and Demon Lord Leon. To me, that was an issue that couldn't be ignored.

*What if, hypothetically, Demon Lord Leon is spreading misfortune?*

As someone whose life was saved by Demon Lord Leon, I felt a duty to correct any mistakes he might have made.

"Then, Fuze-kun. I'm going to return to wandering, so please take care of things with Heinz-san."

"Got it. I'll let him know. But you'll visit Blumund again sometime, right?"

"Of course!"

"Then let me treat you to a meal when you do."

"Yeah, looking forward to it."

"Shizu-dono, when you visit our Kingdom of Grada, please come see me as well. Now that our guardian deity has gone, your connection with us will nurture the peace of mind of the people."

"I understand, Al-san. I'll be sure to reach out when that time comes."

"Please! I'll prepare delicious food to welcome you."

"Ahaha, I've already been treated to plenty this time, so you don't need to go through so much trouble."

With a feeling of reluctance hidden within, I turned my back on them.

"See you! Shizu-san, take care!"

"I wish you the best of luck!"

Without turning back to their voices, I raised one hand in acknowledgment. Then I started walking.

*If Demon Lord Leon is involved in Echidna's evil deeds...* It would be my duty to stop his wrongdoing with my own hands. Thus began my investigation into the vast organization of Echidna.

This marked the beginning of my fateful connection with Echidna. Soon, I would find myself embroiled in a great battle.

I wished to extend my hand to those I could save with it. I prayed that the grief and sadness pervading this world may diminish, even slightly. I aspired to become a beacon of hope for the weak and vulnerable. My journey would not end until my life did.

<<May we meet again someday, somewhere.>>
