# Story 6: Coleus's Dream|Part 2

"Thank you for saving my elder sister."

The woman who greeted me in front of the large mansion was young and beautiful. The older sister she referred to was Ulamuth-san, Count Guratol's wife. Unbelievably, this meant that the person before me was Jeff-sensei's younger sister.

So, when Jeff-sensei mentioned having connections, it was because his own sister had married into this family. It dawned on me that the old man might have sent me here because he sensed something ominous in the Kingdom of Coleus. He likely wanted me to work for the sake of his younger sister.

Just like with Baron Velyard, it was frustrating how Jeff-sensei made me owe him a favor without revealing his true intentions. This is how nobles operate... I felt defeated once again. However, I couldn't ignore the fact that this request was also beneficial to me. Given the situation, I decided to cooperate as much as I could.

"My name is Chiffon, Chiffon Jahil. I am Count Jeff Irigal's younger sister and the first wife of Barak Jahil," she introduced herself, bowing politely.

Paulo was clearly captivated by her beauty. Her tanned brown skin radiated health, and her glossy golden hair shimmered in the light. Though Ulamuth-san was still recovering from an illness and was undeniably beautiful, Chiffon-san was not outdone. Her youth and vitality seemed to surpass her, even.

"I'm Paulo! Believe it or not, I'm an A-minus rank adventurer."

Paulo pushed me aside to introduce himself. Chiffon-san was indeed beautiful, but she was a married woman. I couldn't help but worry if Paulo understood that. However, it seemed my concern was unnecessary.

"Well, that's wonderful. We would be delighted to entertain you at our humble abode, so please make yourself at home," Chiffon-san replied with a smile.

She then called for the servants and had Paulo escorted to a guest room. Paulo didn't have a chance to say a word against that forceful attitude.

"Uh, um..."

He was whisked away by the muscular servants, who appeared to have high combat abilities---likely just under B rank. Even for Paulo, facing several of them would be a challenge. He cast a reluctant glance back as he was led away.

"Phew, now that the nuisance is gone," Chiffon-san said, her tone shifting. "We've prepared a guest room for you, Rimuru-sama, but first, please enjoy our house's pride---the onsen and sauna. I'll inform you when my husband returns, so until then, please relax."

Chiffon-san's demeanor quickly changed as she treated me with great courtesy. Taking her words to heart, I decided to relieve my travel fatigue.

![hard scene break]

Here in Herbaria, the town surrounded an oasis. The spring that bubbled up in the center was a natural hot spring, more wonderful than I had imagined. There was a sun-heated sandpit, a small artificial spring, a sauna, a cold bath, a sand bath, an indoor bath, and even an open-air bath. Considering that all of these were privately owned, it was clear how powerful and influential the House of Marquis Jahil truly was.

Securing a water source in the desert was equivalent to holding the lives of everyone in the surrounding area.

"Wow, I'm amazed at how extensive Jeff-sensei's connections are," I muttered, feeling relaxed for the first time in a while as I enjoyed the various baths.

After I had finished bathing, Chiffon-san came over. "My husband has returned, so I'm here to inform you. We've also prepared a meal, so if you wish, please join us."

Following her guidance, I arrived at the great hall. A long table was lined with a sumptuous feast. There were no chairs, only cushions with backrests on the carpeted floor, similar to floor chairs. My honest impression was that it must be difficult to keep clean.

At the head of the table sat a dignified man with red hair and brown skin. He stood up when he saw me.

"Welcome, Rimuru-dono. I'm glad to have you here."

The man addressing me must be Barak Jahil, the head of the house. Despite being in his early twenties, he exuded a remarkably strong presence. I could tell immediately that he was stronger than Paulo.

"Thank you very much. Should I address you as Marquis Jahil?" I asked.

"Barak is fine. You are a benefactor to my wife, which makes you a benefactor to me as well. There's no need for formality between us," Barak replied with a hearty laugh.

I immediately sensed that he was a very genuine person.

Chiffon-san was the only other person seated at the table.

"Huh? Where's Paulo?" I inquired.

Barak answered, "That man is a warrior, but he lacks refinement. While he may be valuable on the battlefield, he's not suited to be a guest in this household. Since he's with you, Rimuru-dono, we will provide him with a roof, but there's no obligation to lavish him with hospitality."

His statement was perfectly reasonable. In fact, I hadn't expected to be treated so well myself.

"Rest assured, we've prepared a meal for him," Chiffon-san said.

*If that's the case, then I guess there's no problem?*

I wasn't Paulo's guardian, and he was an adult capable of taking care of himself. With that in mind, I pushed thoughts of Paulo out of my mind.

It was time to eat. When the curtain at the front of the great hall was raised, a band that had been waiting there began to play. Dancers appeared, performing a martial dance as if engaged in a real battle.

They were both beautiful and skilled, with strength equivalent to B rank adventurers. These dancers served as both Chiffon-san's maids and bodyguards. I appreciated the effort they put into entertaining me, as the martial dance was said to be a rare performance.

I thoroughly enjoyed the exotic cuisine while watching the captivating songs and dances.

![hard scene break]

After enjoying a delicious dinner and a pleasant evening, it was time for a more serious discussion. We moved to a room designated for private talks.

Seated on a U-shaped sofa were myself and the Jahil couple. Barak, who had been sipping on some alcohol, showed no signs of inebriation. He fixed me with a sharp gaze and asked in a heavy tone, "Now then, Rimuru-dono. I prefer to get straight to the point. I'll ask plainly: have you come to take Chiffon away?"

*Uhm?*

I was momentarily taken aback by the question. It was different from what I had expected, but after a moment of thought, I understood.

"Ah, I see. You thought I came to take Chiffon-san away at Jeff-sensei's request."

"Is that not the case? Despite how my brother appears, he is very kind to his family. I assumed that was the purpose of your visit..."

While Jeff-sensei might have had such intentions, I hadn't heard anything about it. I answered clearly, "No."

Although the Jahil couple still seemed unconvinced, the husband---Barak-san---shifted his attitude and spoke.

"Hmm. If that's not the case, then your purpose must be related to the Free Guild. The tension in our country is surely known to the higher-ups of other nations."

"Yes, indeed. Our country receives aid from various nations in exchange for our role as the guardian of the extreme end. From a security standpoint, they must view the current situation as unfavorable."

Following her husband's lead, Chiffon-san also began discussing such matters. This reminded me of something.

Before coming here, I had researched the Kingdom of Coleus, which served as a bulwark for the western nations. To the west stretched a barren wasteland, protecting humanity from the vicious monsters in the desert of death.

The total population was just under five million. There was no distinction between citizens and Freemen; if you lived here, military service was mandatory. This included tasks like transporting supplies, so not everyone was directly involved in combat.

However, most of the population was strong, and if motivated, they could assemble a military force numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Originally a harsh land with low domestic crop production, Coleus had managed to secure support from various countries through its battles with monsters, thereby maintaining its status as a nation.

Therefore, what Chiffon-san said was accurate. An internal conflict in the Kingdom of Coleus would be unwelcome to neighboring countries. Even if Yuuki didn't intervene, other nations would eventually step in to mediate.

The Jahil couple was surely well aware of this. In that case, there was no point in trying to deceive them.

"That's correct. My purpose is to investigate which side the Free Guild will support. While we cannot condone Prince Aslan's declaration of independence, depending on the situation, collaboration might be possible."

"Hmm. From my standpoint, that's not something I can welcome."

"My husband is Prince Sauzer's most trusted confidant, so please forgive his current statement."

From what I knew, Barak-san was the unifying force behind the faction supporting Prince Sauzer. He seemed to act as Prince Aslan's counterpart and was considered the strongest warrior in the Kingdom of Coleus until a few years ago.

The champion of the kingdom versus the champion of the Free Guild---it seemed like a balanced match, despite my initial assumption that the Free Guild might be stronger. The potential for a dangerous confrontation was clear.

I decided it was best to stay uninvolved and focus on gathering information from both sides.

"No, I believe that's a reasonable statement. However, my mission is to gather accurate information, not to determine which side to take. I hope you understand my position on that?"

I made it clear that I had no affiliation with either side.

"I understand. I won't hinder your actions and might even cooperate. There's no need for you to operate under a false name. Tomorrow, accompany me to the royal castle."

*No, no, I want to stay uninvolved.*

My apprehension was confirmed when Barak-san added, "I'll introduce you to Prince Sauzer under my name. You'll get the right answers from him as well."

That was the last thing I wanted.

"No, no, thank you for your kind offer, but due to my position, I must decline."

I politely declined.

It wasn't about making a fair judgment. As the leader of the monster nation, I didn't want to meet leaders from other countries. Handling royalty was delicate; a single misstep could lead to major complications. In fact, I had prepared a false name specifically to avoid such situations. The idea that my mere statement could escalate into an international issue was no laughing matter.

"I see. It's unfortunate, but I won't insist. There was a letter from my brother-in-law urging respect for Rimuru-dono's wishes."

Oh, I was relieved he backed down. I owed thanks to Jeff-sensei.

But that was where I made a mistake---letting my guard down.

While I had managed to avoid meeting the Crown Prince, the trap had another layer.

"Well then! Please do meet Princess Zenobia as well. She is currently suffering from an illness. I've heard from my brother that you are a renowned doctor, Rimuru-sama. Even my brother, who rarely praises anyone, wrote in his letter, 'Ulamuth was saved thanks to Rimuru-sensei.' I'm sure you'll find a way to aid her recovery!" Chiffon-san said with a smile, catching me off guard with her announcement.

It was unfortunate that Princess Zenobia was ill. Maybe, just maybe, I could help her.

And because I was subconsciously thinking about it, Barak-san jumped on my unguarded moment without missing a beat.

"So be it. You will guide Rimuru-dono to Princess Zenobia's room."

Just like that, the conversation was settled, and my schedule for tomorrow was set without any chance for me to interject.

![hard scene break]

The next morning, I saw Paulo off.

"But I haven't done any investigation or anything!" he grumbled, but that was beside the point.

"Just go. Head to the Free Guild's tavern or wherever and ask why it's closed. And then, you know, just complain about something."

"Complain?"

"Yeah. Something like, 'I came all this way as an escort for a noble's acquaintance, but now I'm stuck in a bind because he's so selfish.' Just make up whatever you need."

"I see!" Paulo's eyes sparkled.

With that, he departed from the mansion in high spirits. I had given him some pocket money and told him he could enjoy drinking, so I doubted he'd remember much of what he heard there. But that was fine.

From the start, I never expected Paulo to gather any useful information.

<Souei, are you there?>

<Right here.>

Good, good. I trusted Souei to keep a close watch.

The Kingdom of Ingracia had a powerful Barrier, so he couldn't enter the town. However, this country didn't have such a strong Barrier. Many practitioners here used monsters, and sand lizards were common for pulling wagons in the desert. They were stronger and more useful than horses.

I was confident Souei would be able to operate effectively, and it seemed I was right.

Incidentally, I no longer wore a mask even in the Kingdom of Ingracia. After researching it, I realized I didn't need to wear it on my face. As a slime, my face was merely part of my mimicry. Simply carrying the mask was enough to activate its effect of concealing my Youki.

I gave Souei an order.

<Follow that man named Paulo and listen to all his conversations. If he gets attacked, assist him.>

<Understood!>

With that, one of Souei's Clones separated and disappeared into the shadows, while the remaining one sank into my own shadow. I marveled at how convenient this was and watched as the Clone left.

![hard scene break]

With preparations complete, I waited for the Jahil couple. Today, they would pick me up and drop me off in the same carriage. In other words, there was no escape.

As I resigned myself to the situation and was jolted by the carriage, the royal castle came into view. No one stopped the Marquis Family's carriage; we passed through the gates and crossed the bridge without hindrance.

As soon as we arrived, Barak-san headed off to the Crown Prince's office. After seeing him off, I was guided by Chiffon-san to the harem.

By the way, my current attire was, for some reason, a hand-me-down from Chiffon-san. The skirt had pants underneath, so I managed to endure it. The black fabric with gold embroidery was quite luxurious. It felt like cotton, but I could sense some magical properties in it. It seemed materials obtained from monsters were also used.

The outfit was perfect, but no matter how I looked at it, I appeared as an adorable girl. I wanted to express my dissatisfaction, but there was a reason for the attire.

One reason was to avoid being disrespectful to the royal family, but more importantly...

"Because men aren't allowed in the harem."

With that said, I had no choice but to accept it. If it was that much trouble, there was no need to meet the princess---but, to be honest, I didn't want to meet her in the first place. My opinion, however, was completely ignored.

A pleasant breeze blew through the corridor lined with columns. The first floor had walls but no doors, an architectural style unique to this region that allowed the breeze to flow freely through every room.

On the way here, I noticed that while the buildings had windows, there was no glass. Unlike the Kingdom of Ingracia, such items seemed to be considered luxury goods here.

"We have few craftsmen in our country, so not just glass but all sorts of manufacturing techniques are lagging behind. If it's something we can import, it's manageable, but fragile items inevitably get pushed to the back of the list," Chiffon-san explained.

*I see, that makes sense.* Discussing something I was interested in made me feel a bit more at ease. Grateful for that, I continued following Chiffon-san.

After turning a few corners, I gave up on trying to remember the route. However, it wasn't a problem. Even if I didn't memorize the way, I had a mental map. I activated the display function and kept pace with Chiffon-san. Suddenly, a heavily guarded group approached from the end of the corridor.

"Tch."

"Hm?"

"O-ho-ho, it's nothing at all. But Rimuru-sama, I must apologize in advance. You might find this encounter a bit unpleasant. Please bear with it."

Trouble seemed to be brewing. I nodded and cleared my mind.

Right then, a man leading the group spoke with an air of arrogance.

"Well, well, if it isn't the Marchioness. Are you here to visit Princess Zenobia?"

"Yes, that's correct, Court Physician Gustav."

The man addressed as Gustav had light purple hair slicked back and wore refined clothing. It wasn't the Arabian-style attire popular in this country but rather a Western-style outfit with ample fabric. His attire was lavish, to say the least, and included an eye-catching pendant with a purple gemstone that looked very expensive.

His skin was sickly pale, and his eyes were bloodshot. He was of average build, with sunken cheeks that gave him an unhealthy appearance. I couldn't help but worry about the state of this country if someone like this was a doctor. Despite his sickly appearance, he leered at Chiffon-san with a grin that seemed lascivious.

"Hohoho, well, well. If you have time later, I would love for you to visit my place. I could check your health while we chat."

"No, no, I couldn't possibly trouble the Court Physician with such a thing," Chiffon-san replied, clearly refusing. Her words were polite, but it was evident she deeply disliked this Court Physician Gustav.

"Gu-fu-fu, no need to be so reserved."

"No, truly. I have a guest today, so perhaps another time."

"A guest, you say?"

*Ah, so this is where she brings me into it.*

Feeling Gustav's persistent gaze on me made my skin crawl. This was definitely unpleasant.

"Ohhh, are you planning to introduce her as a friend to the Princess?"

"I'm sorry, that's not it at all. This person here is Rimuru-sama, and she's brought a very rare medicine. I asked her to come in hopes that it might benefit Princess Zenobia in some way."

"Oh?"

Gustav, who had been grinning before, suddenly frowned in displeasure.

"Absurd! It is because of my treatments that Princess Zenobia enjoys peace! And yet, you dare to invite some unknown charlatan here. It's distasteful. I will report this to His Majesty and ensure that your foolishness is punished!"

With that outburst, Gustav stormed off, his attendants hurriedly following after him. It was a stormy encounter. I certainly never wanted to meet him again.

"Me aside, Chiffon-san, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Gustav holds a high position as Court Physician, but he lacks the rizz. In this country, martial strength is valued above all else, so no one in our Marquis family would dare defy him."

That was a relief to hear. However, that aside... Was it just my imagination?

As we passed by Court Physician Gustav, I caught an extremely unpleasant smell. It was an indescribable stench, like the odor of death---something I never wanted to experience again.

It not only made me feel unpleasant but also gave me a foreboding feeling.

![hard scene break]

Princess Zenobia's room was in a secluded part of the harem, adorned with a riot of colorful flowers. The room was well-ventilated and comfortable, with no direct sunlight. It seemed to be maintained in a very comfortable condition, likely thanks to the efforts of the maids standing by in the room.

"Oh my, who might this be?"

"I'm glad to see you're awake. Princess Zenobia, today I have brought someone I would like you to meet."

"That voice...is it Chiffon? It's rare for you to bring someone along."

As I observed, it became clear that Princess Zenobia was blind. Whether from birth or due to illness, her lack of sight was evident. The abundance of flowers likely served to provide her with their pleasant fragrances.

As Chiffon-san and Princess Zenobia began their conversation, the maids moved efficiently and quietly. One assisted Princess Zenobia into a seated position, while another went outside to arrange refreshments.

All of this happened without a word. It seemed they were thoroughly trained not to interrupt their mistress's conversation. The maids' coordination was impressive, but Chiffon-san gently tapped my hand, redirecting my focus to the princess.

"This is Rimuru-sama. She is the one who treated my sister and cured her illness. She is truly remarkable and I believe she can uncover the cause of your illness as well."

*Uh-oh*, this situation was turning out to be more complicated than I anticipated. Maybe I shouldn't have taken this on so lightly, thinking I might be able to understand what was wrong.

Suddenly feeling heavy and nervous, I somehow manage to get out a greeting.

"I am Rimuru, as introduced. Today, I humbly ask for your permission to examine you, Princess."

*Was that okay?* I watched for the princess's reaction with some anxiety.

She responded with a light-hearted laugh. "That's quite all right. But, I don't like pain, so please be gentle with me."

Princess Zenobia tilted her face slightly in my direction, her lips forming a slight pout. It was an incredibly cute gesture, perfectly suited to her.

As I took in her appearance, the word "fairy-like" came to mind. Not in a contrived way like Ramiris, but the genuine, storybook kind of cuteness.

Her skin was pale, likely due to lack of sun exposure, and her golden hair was soft and radiant. It was such a pity that her eyes were closed. Though she was eighteen, she appeared much younger, resembling a late elementary school student. Her growth seemed stunted, likely due to being bedridden for the past three years.

Her nutritional state seemed good, but---

<<Objection. It appears that makeup is masking the truth. The thinness of her arms and legs suggests she is consuming very little food, possibly masked by makeup.>>

Upon closer inspection, I realized that Great Sage was right. It was time to use Analyze and Assess to gather more detailed information.

"Coincidentally, I also dislike pain. I used to think during every health check-up, 'I wish they would just let me finish my treatments while I'm asleep.'"

I was speaking my true feelings. In my twenties, I didn't worry much about my health, but once I hit thirty, I became more concerned. I even had to undergo a comprehensive medical check-up, including a gastroscopy---though that's beside the point here.

Since I had received the princess's permission, I pretended to conduct a physical examination while actually activating Analyze and Assess. To my surprise, no abnormalities were detected.

<<...Objection. Given her current state of health, these results are unnatural. The cause is unknown, so it is recommended to take a blood sample and analyze its components.>>

I'd never done it before, but if it was necessary...

I transformed the tip of my finger into a small needle and gently pricked Princess Zenobia's arm.

"...?"

For a brief moment, Princess Zenobia looked puzzled, but she didn't seem to feel any pain. Relieved, I asked Great Sage to conduct the blood test.

<<...Report. The blood test results are in. They indicate severe malnutrition, leading to a state of extreme weakness.>>

*Hmmm*. Despite Analyze and Assess showing no abnormalities, she was clearly in a weakened state. Was something interfering with my abilities?

<<Affirmative. Since the cause is unknown, symptomatic treatment is recommended. Please provide the individual with honey as medicine.>>

*I see, we have that option.* Apito's honey had remarkable healing properties, capable of curing various conditions and even aiding in recovery from incurable diseases. Although the cause of her weakness was unknown, this honey should help Princess Zenobia regain her strength.

"Just to confirm, you're eating your meals properly and not being picky, right?"

"How dare you speak to the princess like that?"

"Even if you are a renowned doctor, you must show more respect."

My unintentional casual tone earned me a scolding from the maids. However, I received confirmation that the princess did eat three meals a day, albeit in small quantities.

"Well then, I shall give you this medicine. It's a universal remedy, so please take a spoonful after each meal. Even if you consume the entire bottle, there shouldn't be any problems. Just make sure to take it consistently."

As I said this, I offered a small bottle of honey to the princess. Although my supply was limited, I had enough to share. Great Sage had determined that this amount would be sufficient to address any illness, so I trusted that assessment.

"Oh my, what is this? I don't like anything bitter, just so you know."

"This is actually my favorite. You can have one of your maids taste it first and give you their opinion."

"A favorite medicine?" The princess looked puzzled.

One of the maids took a taste of the honey beside the princess.

"---Oh my!" she exclaimed, her face lighting up with delight.

*See? It's delicious, isn't it?* I thought, feeling a bit relieved.

"Does it have to be taken only after meals?"

The maid, unusually, interjected with a question.

"No, you can have it as a snack on its own, or mix it into tea. It's also yummy drizzled over cookies or cake."

"---Tone."

I couldn't help but answer cheerfully, prompting a quiet reminder from Chiffon-san.

"Ah, I mean, I believe it would be quite tasty."

I hastily corrected myself, but it seemed everyone, including the princess, pretended not to notice.

Right on cue, tea was brought in. The princess added the honey to her tea and took a sip.

"Oh, it's delicious!"

The princess smiled, but a dramatic change occurred immediately after.

"Ah, it's so bright..."

"Princess?"

"Could it be...are you able to perceive light?"

The maids were in a flurry of excitement, and Chiffon-san watched the princess intently, clearly tense.

Everyone's attention was fixed on Princess Zenobia as her eyelids slowly opened, revealing her beautiful blue eyes.

"I can see... I can see!"

Cheers erupted, and the room was filled with jubilation.

"Thank you, Rimuru-sama... Thank you so much!"

Overwhelmed with emotion, Chiffon-san and Princess Zenobia embraced each other in joy, while the maids shed tears. I watched over the heartwarming scene.

![hard scene break]

And then, in the evening, I sat in the guest room assigned to me, facing Souei.

A grand celebration had been hastily arranged at the Marquis Jahil House. I had tried to offer my assistance, but the servants had kindly refused with smiles.

Left with nothing to do, I decided to hear Souei's report.

"I shall proceed with my report."

"Yeah. What was Prince Aslan like?"

"Yes, I sensed an incredibly strong presence from him. If I were to fight him one-on-one, I'd say my chances are fifty-fifty."

No way! I hadn't expected Prince Aslan to impress even someone like Souei so much. To be honest, I had underestimated him. I had heard he was hailed as a champion of the Free Guild, but Yuuki's assessment that he was a Special A rank seemed accurate. In other words, he was on par with Shizu-san in strength.

"Do you think Benimaru could win?"

"If there were no restrictions at all, I don't think he would lose."

Well then, so Hell Flare would win, huh? But that would cause too much damage, so I thought it should be a last resort. In the first place, we didn't come here to fight, so let's try to avoid hostility as much as possible.

"From your perspective, what kind of person was he?"

"He seemed gallant and considerate of his comrades, leaving the impression of a fine young man with the demeanor of a ruler."

It was quite a compliment. It seemed he was someone you wouldn't want to make an enemy of. According to Yuuki, major countries and their equivalents have several Over A rank warriors. Considering that Coleus here was a martial nation entrusted with the western frontier, it was only natural that such an individual would be present.

"If you're saying that, he must be quite the opponent. In that case, supporting the Aslan faction might be the right choice. By the way, Paulo handled things well, did he?"

Souei had gathered so much information, so he must have integrated well. That was what I was thinking when I asked, but...

"Hmmm, he's hopeless. The moment he entered the bar, he ordered alcohol and snacks and did nothing but badmouth you, Rimuru-sama."

*Oh, ohh*. I had told him to do that, but...

"Badmouthing? Not venting?"

"Yes. Arrogant, rough with people, stingy---the list goes on. To be honest, I even considered taking care of him halfway through."

Hey, hey, that guy. Acting like he could do whatever he wanted when he thought no one was listening. Since he still hadn't come back, I was a bit worried, but it seemed that concern was unnecessary.

"However, thanks to that, he wasn't suspected of anything. It seems he's now being invited to join them as a comrade, so it doesn't look like he'll be coming back today."

"Well, it's still going according to plan..."

"Yes. It went according to your strategy, Rimuru-sama, so I've been observing as instructed."

That was good. If things hadn't gone well, Paulo might not have made it. For now, Paulo could be left alone.

"Alright, in that case, I'll go take care of something. I'll leave Paulo's surveillance to you."

"Understood."

After Souei nodded in agreement, I closed my eyes.

![hard scene break]

I snapped my eyes open---or rather, I activated Magic Sense.

I was in the courtyard of the inner palace. In a corner among the plants, I had secretly concealed a Clone to avoid detection. Unlike Souei, I couldn't control them simultaneously. Well, when the Clone was within my line of sight, it felt like manipulating an avatar in a game, but once it was out of range, it became impossible.

So, I put my main body to sleep and woke up in the Clone.

Why was I doing this? For a simple reason. I suspected Princess Zenobia was being interfered with by someone. I had healed her, but that surely wasn't something amusing for whoever was behind this. I was certain they would set something up in return.

With Great Sage in agreement, it seemed almost certain.

I silently followed along the pillar, clinging to the ceiling. Checking my mental map, I headed towards Princess Zenobia's room. There was a patrol soldier ahead. In times like these, Magic Sense, which allowed me to survey my surroundings, was incredibly useful.

*Fufufu, I wonder if I'm naturally suited for spying?*

Praising myself, I arrived at my destination.

*Oops*, maybe because it was the princess's room, there was a door that hadn't been there during the day. Did it come from above? Maybe they were using magic somehow, but it seemed they made it hard to enter easily.

But even in such a situation, I didn't panic. As an amorphous slime, I could infiltrate a room through even the smallest gap.

Don't mean to brag, but I was quite something. Maybe I was more suited to being a thief than a spy. It wasn't exactly the most flattering method, but using my slime characteristics and skills, I felt confident I could handle any mission effortlessly.

With those thoughts in mind, I found the keyhole. Silently slipping through it, I carefully observed the inside. It seemed the princess was absent. With no maids around, she must have gone for a meal or a bath.

Seizing the opportunity, I slipped into the room and laid my slime body in the shadow of a potted plant in a corner.

![hard scene break]

I snapped my consciousness back.

I was on the bed in the assigned room. Relieved that everything had gone smoothly, I checked on my main body. I wasn't quite used to it yet, but this skill proved to be quite handy.

I got up without any issues. Glancing around, I saw Ranga sprawled out at my feet.

"My lord, no suspicious individuals approached!"

"Ohh, thank you for your vigilance."

I expressed my gratitude while petting Ranga. As I continued, it was time for dinner. There was no door in the room, only a curtain separating it. From beyond it, a voice called out to me.

"Rimuru-sama, preparations for the banquet are complete. Please get ready soon."

It was Chiffon-san herself, who came to greet me. I concealed Ranga in the shadows and replied, "I'll be right there."

Following her guidance, I entered the hall. Inside, nearly fifty people awaited my entrance.

*Hey, hey, it seems I'm being treated as the guest of honor,* I thought to myself.

"Let me introduce him to you all! He is our honored guest and also the benefactor of Princess Zenobia---Rimuru-dono! As a skilled apothecary, I ask that you all treat him with respect."

The head of the family, Barak-san, introduced me with a commanding voice. I wasn't just treated like a main character; I was *the* main character.

The banquet began, but it wasn't exactly enjoyable. People kept coming one after another to greet me, and I didn't even have a moment to eat. It started with nobles related to the Marquis Jahil Family, followed by knights and wealthy merchants.

I smiled politely and nodded along, but it was quite a challenging time, to say the least.

As time passed, two hours went by, and it seemed like the banquet was finally coming to a close---or so I thought. The real event was about to begin.

"I apologize; it must have been exhausting for you," Chiffon-san apologized.

"Well, yes, it was."

"Hahaha," Barak-san laughed. "That's how it goes with the nobility. Forgive us."

"No, it's okay, really."

The Marquis and his wife, not quite acting like typical high nobility, seemed genuinely apologetic. They were concerned about me, so I assured them it was fine. After that, we moved to a quieter area to relax. There, a warm meal was prepared, and I finally had the chance to unwind.

At that moment, today's events became the topic of discussion.

"Ku-ku-ku, I can just imagine the Court Physician's frustration. Acting so freely in the court just because he's valued by His Majesty," Barak-san said.

"He's a cunning man. We couldn't touch him until now, but if the princess has recovered, His Majesty might reconsider. His glory may come to an end," Chiffon-san added.

The Jahir couple seemed pleased. I didn't sympathize much with the Court Physician since he was rather annoying. I figured it was his own fault and left it at that.

As we finished discussing everything, voices from a distant place began to clamor. I thought maybe Paulo had returned, but it was something else. One of the servants hurriedly entered and reported to Barak-san.

"I---I have a report! Prince Aslan has just arrived at the front entrance. He says he has something important to discuss with you. How should we proceed?"

It was past midnight, quite late for a visit, and understandable if it caused some trouble. Normally, they might have turned away such a late visitor, but this was no ordinary guest---it was Prince Aslan. Moreover, he was a formidable figure with charisma, so it was a decision that the servants likely found difficult to make.

Thinking it was quite a predicament, I considered it as if it were someone else's problem.

"Hmm, he's not here for me but for you, Rimuru-dono."

"Huh?"

"Prince Aslan must be grateful to Rimuru-sama for healing the princess."

"That's right. Otherwise, he wouldn't have snuck into my house, which belongs to the faction opposing him."

As the couple discussed this, I found myself perplexed. Barak-san turned to me and asked, "Shall we show him in? Is that alright with you?"

I didn't think I had much choice, so I simply nodded in silence.

![hard scene break]

"Sorry for the intrusion at this late hour," Prince Aslan said as he entered.

Indeed, as Souei had described, he was a nobleman with a commanding presence. With tan skin, short blond hair, and blue eyes, he was strikingly handsome. His taut muscles full of vitality, peeking through his partially exposed shirt, exuded an aura akin to a fierce carnivorous beast.

"I don't mind, Your Highness Aslan. It's been a while since we talked like this, but I trust your sword arm hasn't dulled?"

"Hah! Don't act all superior just because you once taught me a thing or two about swords!" Despite their banter, there was an oddly friendly atmosphere between them. Thinking it was just my imagination, I observed them.

Prince Aslan sat down heavily, and without permission, picked up a goblet of wine. Barak-san, however, silently poured for him. It was hard to believe they were supposed adversaries, given their casual demeanor. Without showing any sign of suspicion towards poison, Prince Aslan quickly drank from his goblet, then turned toward me.

"So, you're Rimuru. Thank you for saving my sister," he said, bowing his head---a gesture that left not just me, but even Marquis Jahil and his wife, astonished. With a wry smile at our reactions, Prince Aslan continued.

"We were close, despite having different mothers. I respected my elder brother and planned to support him as Chief of Military Affairs when he became king. I honed my sword skills for that purpose, and days spent fighting monsters were no hardship. But then---" His tone turned mournful as he spoke of his brother, Crown Prince Sauzer.

"At first, when Zenobia fell ill, both my brother and I thought it was just a cold. But it wasn't. Her waking hours grew shorter, and eventually, she lost her sight. I was desperate, but they said nothing more could be done..."

It was Court Physician Gustav, serving as the royal doctor, who had said so. He indicated that this was a problem beyond the reach of force, and that Prince Aslan had no choice but to resign himself to it.

"If this were truly an illness, one could consider it fate," Prince Aslan continued. "Or could it be something else?" Barak-san asked, to which Prince Aslan nodded vigorously.

"Barak, have you had the opportunity to meet His Majesty lately?"

"No, I haven't."

"Doesn't that seem suspicious to you?"

"What do you mean---no, now that you mention it...why haven't I?"

Barak-san's demeanor changed as he realized the oddity of the situation. "If His Majesty is seriously ill, only Court Physician Gustav would be allowed to meet with him..."

"That's right. I've been requesting an audience for years, but it hasn't been granted. Can you believe it? Me, the son of the second queen, unable to meet with my father the king!"

"Hm, Hmmm..."

Even though I had just heard about this, it felt very unnatural. The fact that no one had questioned it suggested that everyone had been influenced by some form of interference, almost akin to 'brainwashing.'

"And the fact that you, the high-ranking nobles, haven't found it strange proves the dire state of this country!" Prince Aslan declared, leaving Barak-san unable to refute his words.

*But if that's the case, then why...?*

"Are you wondering why I haven't revealed this until now?" Prince Aslan asked. "It's simple. Not only Zenobia, but even my beloved elder brother has fallen into Gustav's hands."

"What?! Such a statement cannot be ignored, even if it comes from Your Highness."

"Do you think Crown Prince Sauzer is the mastermind, Prince Aslan?"

Prince Aslan responded resolutely to the worried Jahir couple. "Think about it. My sickly elder brother Sauzer suddenly became healthy and gained power three years ago. It can't be unrelated, can it?"

No one could argue against that.

"So, Prince Aslan, you believe that Crown Prince Sauzer is behind Princess Zenobia's illness?" Chiffon-san voiced, pondering the situation.

The timing was certainly suspicious---Princess Zenobia fell ill three years ago, just as Crown Prince Sauzer suddenly became healthy and gained power. It was almost eerie that no one had questioned it until now.

"Don't be ashamed. You were made to think that way by my brother's Charm."

"Charm?"

"Could it be...!"

"Exactly. It's a specialty of the vampires. I have an associate from Lubelius, and I've been consulting with them. They told me about the characteristics of vampires, and our situation fits perfectly, doesn't it?"

"Hold on, Your Highness. That doesn't add up. Crown Prince Sauzer was undoubtedly human, and even if he was turned into a subordinate of the vampires, he operates in broad daylight without any issues."

"Yes, that puzzled me too. So I inquired further and learned that the higher ranks of the vampire species can indeed withstand sunlight."

"No way..." Chiffon-san was speechless. However, Barak-san still seemed unconvinced.

"So, Your Highness suspects that Court Physician Gustav is a vampire, manipulating Crown Prince Sauzer as his subordinate?"

"That is one possibility. But I suspect something else. I believe that Sauzer might have been injected with Origin Blood, transforming him into a high-ranking pseudo-vampire."

"Origin Blood?" I couldn't help but ask. Prince Aslan glanced at me briefly before answering without much concern.

"Yes. My old friend Karl suspects that this isn't merely a power struggle for the throne of a single kingdom but a sabotage operation orchestrated by Demon Lord Valentin against humanity's defenses."

The room fell silent. I, too, was momentarily speechless. What was supposed to be a simple task of deciding which prince's faction to support had suddenly escalated into a grand tale involving a Demon Lord. At this point, there was no backing out. Supporting Paulo was no longer the issue---the risks had far outstripped any potential reward.

I didn't want to deal with a Demon Lord; it was a matter of life and death. But given that I couldn't escape, I needed to think carefully about my next steps. As I was lost in these gloomy thoughts...

"Hrmmph!" Barak-san suddenly stood up and shouted, his face twisted in a mix of shock and realization.

"No way... Even I have been Charmed..."

"Oh, Violent Break, huh? Impressive. Your skills haven't waned."

So it turned out to be some kind of technique?

<<Affirmative. It appears to be an art that circulates Battlewill throughout the body to detect and expel foreign elements.>>

Now that it had been mentioned, I noticed that Barak-san's Battlewill had filled his body, making him seem larger. This technique was likely used in combat, but this time, its purpose was to resist the Charm affecting him.

"What are you saying? As you mentioned, it appears I've been under a Charm, Prince Aslan. I beg your forgiveness for falling so easily into the hands of a demonic being." Barak-san knelt before Prince Aslan, offering an apology. By breaking the Charm with his own strength, he had decided to fully trust Prince Aslan.

"My dear..." Chiffon-san began.

"Chiffon, take my hand." Barak-san instructed. As she complied, his Battlewill surged into her, dispelling any lingering malevolent influence.

"Hmm, it seems you weren't as deeply affected since you spent less time in close contact with Crown Prince Sauzer. It's fortunate we noticed it at this point," Barak-san observed.

"I see. The Charm must have prevented us from speaking out until now," Chiffon-san realized.

"Hmph, exactly! Because of that, baseless suspicions arose about me attempting to usurp the throne. Though I appreciate that you still trusted me," Prince Aslan replied.

"If only you had confided in us sooner..." Barak-san lamented.

"Fool! Things have worked out now, but that's only in hindsight. I couldn't reveal anything until I had gathered enough evidence to convince your suspicious minds."

"My apologies. So, you do have definitive proof, then?"

"There is indeed. Karl has captured the black market merchant who sold the Origin Blood to Gustav. With his testimony, our legitimacy will be proven beyond doubt."

"Oooh!"

I felt like I had been left behind in the conversation, but it seemed the problem was on the verge of being resolved. Initially, I was worried we'd have to confront Demon Lord Valentin, but it looked like the situation could be addressed by arresting Court Physician Gustav.

Now that Prince Aslan and Barak-san had joined forces, the power of Sauzer's faction was significantly weakened. If it was revealed that Sauzer was actually a vampire, the Aslan faction's victory seemed inevitable.

"Rimuru-dono, I must thank you again for saving my sister. With your medicine, Zenobia will not have to become a vampire," Prince Aslan said gratefully.

"Indeed. Today, the princess enjoyed a stroll in the garden for the first time in a long while. Though she still cannot walk on her own, she was delightfully admiring the flowers under the sunlight," Chiffon-san replied.

"I know. Hearing that brought me immense joy!" Prince Aslan responded, clearly moved.

"Hmm, it appears the princess has only been weakened and not turned into a vampire. Since Crown Prince Sauzer deeply cherishes her, it's possible he's protecting her with his last shreds of reason," Barak-san mused.

"I want to believe that too," Prince Aslan agreed. "Anyway, our priority should be to deal with the traitor Gustav. Since Origin Blood seems to be a curse, if we can somehow handle the mastermind, we might be able to rescue my brother."

"I, Barak, would like to offer my humble assistance," Barak-san offered.

"I'm counting on it," Prince Aslan replied.

With that, everything seemed neatly settled. Though I played a minor role, I was now fully committed to aiding in the mission to save Princess Zenobia.
