# Story 4: Kuro and the Mask

In a dark forest, a woman knelt in a small clearing, lamenting. At the center of the clearing lay her companion, barely breathing.

The rugged man with short-cropped hair had three large wounds on his back---fatal injuries that left him with little time to live. The woman knew this all too well. She understood that no matter what she tried, it was impossible to save him.

*I won't forgive them. Those demons---I'll never forgive them.*

Without hesitation, she resorted to forbidden magic.

Using the blood flowing from the man, she drew a magic circle filled with her grudge and whispered a prayer. Without regard for the consequences, she poured her own life force into the magic.

They had promised to marry once the mission was over, but that promise would never be fulfilled. So, at the very least...

*I want us to be together at the time of our death*, she thought.

She sought vengeance against those who had deceived and used them. She had no intention of being killed by the pursuers who would soon arrive. That was why she risked everything on this final gamble.

The forbidden magic was a summoning spell, not uncommon by any means. But what it summoned weren't angels or spirits---they were demons.

Evil begets evil.

Resigned to her impending death, the woman had no kindness left to choose a gentler path. Moreover, this was the most reliable method, with the highest success rate.

Unlike angels or spirits, demons always lent their power in exchange for a promise. Summoning a demon beyond one's abilities could lead to their disaster, but for a woman facing the end of her life, such concerns were irrelevant.

Normally composed, she resorted to a forbidden method she would never have considered, ignoring all limits and constraints, to complete the summoning magic.

The summoned demon appeared almost human, dressed in luxurious attire. Golden eyes with a crimson gleam. White skin. Beautiful black hair streaked with red and gold.

"Kufufufu. Are you the fool who summoned me without knowing her place?"

Though spoken in a gentle tone, the question carried an undertone that would send shivers down anyone's spine. Normally, one would fear that voice, but the woman remained unmoved. Her mind was clouded, filled only with a powerful resentment.

"If God won't heed my prayers, then even a demon will do. I offer my soul. Take whatever you desire. Just please, I beg you---that guy, that guy---"

The demon observed her coldly.

Then, with a slight nod, he declared, "Very well. For my amusement, I shall grant your wish."

For the demon, it was merely a whim. He showed only fleeting interest in the woman's intense resentment. However, for the woman, it was the answer she sought.

"Oh, thank you. As for the reward..."

With those words, she collapsed. Exhausted to the core, her life came to an end.

At that same moment, the heartbeat of the man lying beside her also ceased. Just as she had wished, their final moments were synchronized without the slightest delay.

The demon stood alone, looking down at the woman's satisfied expression as her breath faded away.

"Hmm, the contract is complete. Your emotions were quite delicious. Consider this a grand service."

As the demon sneered wickedly, he noticed the sound of approaching footsteps around the clearing.

"However...with a reward of this magnitude, it should last for about three days. For anything lacking..."

*---I can make up for it with the prey the woman has prepared,* the demon thought to himself, chuckling quietly.

In the dark forest, silence fell.

In the next moment, the attackers would realize too late the unimaginable malice born from the final desperate resistance of their quarry.

"Kufufufu, it's been a while since I've been in this realm. I shall enjoy myself to the fullest."

With a sinister smirk, the malice began to move.

In that place, only the bloodstains of those who had died in despair remained...

![soft scene break]

The Kingdom of Filtwood, a small nation with a population of less than three hundred thousand, lay near the Great Forest of Jura.

Shizue Izawa, known as Shizu, was visiting this country at the request of the Kingdom of Blumund, where she had been staying. The urgent plea from Filtwood had been sent to surrounding nations: "Subjugate the resurrected demon." The task was deemed too difficult for ordinary adventurers.

*It's a state request, but something feels off. Even Heinz-san seemed hesitant---maybe I should have turned it down?*

The proposal had come from Heinz, a manager at the Adventurers' Guild. But even he seemed doubtful about the situation.

<Off the record, it's rumored that several skilled individuals have already gone missing. And yet, the cause remains unclear. They claim it's to defeat a resurrected demon, but I'm not convinced.> Heinz confided to Shizu.

Naturally, the Kingdom of Blumund had been conducting its own investigation. However, delving into the internal affairs of Filtwood was not an easy task.

The best they could do was gather rumors. In such circumstances, they sent out the request to the adventurers.

Adventurers often form mutual support systems that transcend national frameworks. Refusing to cooperate could potentially strain relations between nations in the future. For Blumund, the calculation seemed clear---they had to show a cooperative attitude, even if reluctantly.

For Shizu, this was troublesome, but refusal was not an option. The moment Heinz approached her, it was apparent that no one else was capable of handling this task. The request was so perilous that it couldn't be handled without the help of a champion. Understanding this, Shizu had come to Filtwood.

When Shizu arrived at the royal castle, she was greeted by a senior knight.

"Ah, if it isn't Shizue Izawa-sama! It's an honor to meet the renowned Conqueror of Flames!"

Due to her signature mask, Shizu was often recognized without needing to introduce herself, and this time was no different.

The "Anti-Magic Mask" she wore was a genuine magical item. It adhered to her face without straps, as if suctioned on, making it easily distinguishable from fakes. Simply possessing it served as a form of identification.

With a brief greeting, Shizu acknowledged the knight, though she couldn't help but think, *Here we go again*, as she followed her guide.

"A banquet will be held in the hall tonight, so please relax here until then," the knight said, assigning her to a private room.

Such exceptional treatment was only natural. In the adventurers' hierarchy, there were novices, skilled individuals, masters, and above them all, those with "epithets." Shizu was a champion known as the Conqueror of Flames, as the senior knight had addressed her. In the Adventurers' Guild, there was no one who didn't know her name.

"Thank you," Shizu said, accepting the senior knight's suggestion without protest.

In front of other adventurers, treating a champion poorly would have been unthinkable. Shizu felt that refusing the offer would actually be more disrespectful.

And then, night fell.

A different knight from before came to call Shizu. When she was guided into the great hall, she saw that a large number of adventurers had already gathered. Even within the castle, many were still armed. Since the king's quarters were separate, adventurers were permitted to carry their weapons.

The tables were laden with dishes for everyone to help themselves, but the adventurers seemed more interested in exchanging information than in the food.

Shizu, with her distinctive mask, stood out immediately.

Her presence, as a high-ranking adventurer, brought a sense of relief to the gathered crowd. It was only natural---they knew their chances of survival increased when undertaking a quest with someone of her skill.

The room buzzed with excitement at the sight of the famous person, but Shizu remained completely unfazed. She calmly let the gazes wash over her, taking in the state of the venue.

Many renowned figures were present, some of whom were familiar to Shizu. It seemed only those with proven abilities were being approached or spoken to. Adventurers were not volunteers; summoning them required payment. Given that this was a state request, it was impossible to simply ignore their duty.

The assembly of such a group indicated that the resurrected demon they were targeting was likely a formidable foe, possibly on the level of a Greater Demon. The difficulty was feared to be equivalent to a threat of national upheaval. They seemed to be preparing for a Calamity-class scenario, akin to battling a dragon.

As evidence, the security in the grand hall was tight. Several knights were stationed in front of various doors. It seemed others were positioned in separate rooms, and royal castle-employed mages appeared to be on high alert.

"Currently, tensions are high within the castle in preparation for the resurrected demon. In fact, last night--- Oh, my apologies. It seems the minister will soon address this during dinner. Please pardon my earlier remarks."

*Having said so much, you might as well finish the thought,* Shizu mused but reconsidered, mindful of the knight's position.

When Shizu nodded slightly, the knight guiding her bowed and left.

Left alone, Shizu was soon approached in a friendly manner.

"Hey there, Shizu-san! You're here for this quest too?"

The one addressing her was a warrior clad in a striking suit of magic armor---Cougar, someone Shizu had worked with several times before.

Cougar prided himself on his toughness, and his magic armor's ability to provide a "continuous, albeit small, healing effect" made him a reliable frontline warrior.

As someone trustworthy, Shizu responded without hesitation.

"Long time no see, Cougar-san. Heinz-san was hesitant, but it's a commission from the kingdom."

"Kuhh, still as serious as ever," Cougar said and suggested, "You could always come up with some casual excuse and bail out," which made Shizu chuckle wryly.

"You say that, and yet you're here."

"Well, yeah. I'm here for the reward, you know. But now I'm starting to regret it."

Cougar laughed, but his eyes didn't. For a brief moment, he glanced at the knights guarding the door before turning back to Shizu.

That brief glance was enough for Shizu to understand Cougar's intentions.

*Indeed. The knights guarding the door---essentially, this kingdom---are not allies, are they? Despite being the client, they can't be trusted.*

Being deceived by a client was commonplace in this world.

No matter how powerful someone might be, letting their guard down could make them vulnerable. Falling into a trap due to harbored resentment was a risk anyone could face.

Even with national commissions, such scenarios were not unheard of. Many rulers prioritized their own knights, viewing adventurers as expendable pawns.

Shizu had been well-briefed on such matters by Heinz and others, so she could roughly deduce the situation from Cougar's demeanor.

"---Is it true that several skilled individuals have gone missing?"

"...! As expected, you knew about it."

Shizu asked in a hushed voice, and Cougar replied in kind.

Out of sight of the knights, Cougar began explaining the situation to Shizu, maintaining the appearance of casual conversation but speaking in a volume only she could hear.

According to Cougar, the first adventurers had arrived in this country about a month ago. Since then, more adventurers had gradually gathered, but several of them had been brutally murdered during the night. These weren't novices; they had posted lookouts, yet the killings continued.

These incidents occurred at a rate of once a week. The number of victims had already surpassed ten. Moreover, since last night, a team of adventurers known by their epithet, the Silver Wings, had gone missing.

With prominent figures falling victim, anxiety among the adventurers was inevitable. Cougar concluded that a full-scale extermination operation needed to be initiated soon. Otherwise, the dissatisfaction and fear among the adventurers would reach their breaking point.

"I see. So that's why everyone seemed relieved when they saw me."

"Yeah. With a new champion appearing in this situation, even I started feeling hopeful about surviving."

"You're exaggerating."

"Not at all. Now, if only the Silver folks are safe---"

But Cougar's hope was soon shattered by the words of the arriving minister.

![hard scene break]

"Adventurers! I bring unfortunate news. Both of our champions, the Silver Wings, have perished. Their bodies were completely consumed, leaving only traces of blood at the scene."

The minister, flanked by knights, ascended the platform and delivered this grim news as soon as he began speaking.

The great hall fell silent as everyone focused intently on the minister's words, struggling to believe what they were hearing.

"As you all know, the current mission is the 'extermination of the resurrected demon.' It also seems to have been revived a hundred years ago, with warnings recorded in our archives. The demon is described as cunning and dangerous, and our country has been on guard for some time. Since it's not guaranteed that champions will appear this time as they did before, we invited the two champions---the Silver Wings---as esteemed guests of the state. Unfortunately, this is the situation we now face."

The minister spoke with a sorrowful expression.

It seemed that even nobles from the Kingdom of Filtwood had fallen victim. The minister emphasized that there was no time to waste and that immediate measures were necessary.

"Last night, many of our knights also fell victim. Despite our efforts, the vile demon eluded us. But tonight will be different! I implore all of you to lend us your strength."

As soon as the minister finished speaking, the room erupted into chaos.

So far, the investigations had yielded no results, and the enemy's strength remained unknown. The only confirmed detail was that they were dealing with a demon, with little else revealed.

The archives had been thoroughly examined, but the records simply stated, 'The national knight Orthos successfully sealed the demon.' From these records, two things could be inferred: the demon had seemingly manifested in physical form, and it was predicted to potentially resurrect approximately a hundred years later.

Orthos, originally just a soldier, became a champion after repelling the demon and was appointed as a prestigious national knight. He had no family and reportedly went to his grave without ever speaking of the demon again.

In other words, there was no substantial information available.

Given the circumstances and the minister's statement, it was only natural that the room erupted into chaos.

"Hey, are you for real? That demon killed those famous lovebirds---Silver!"

A high-ranking adventurer who seemed to have just arrived shouted at the minister with an accusatory tone.

"Y-you've got to be kidding. Those are champions with the epithet Silver! If even those incredible individuals failed at this mission, we'd be signing our own death warrants!"

"And on top of that, we have no information about the enemy at all. At this rate, it's like you're telling us to go die!"

Shouts of agreement erupted from various corners of the room.

The adventurers' complaints were entirely reasonable, and Shizu felt the same way.

Although she didn't personally know the two members of the Silver Wings, their combination of warrior and mage was reputed to be exceptional. Even Shizu would struggle against both of them simultaneously.

Challenging such a formidable enemy without a strategy, especially one that had defeated high-ranking adventurers, was sheer folly. The adventurers' arguments were entirely justified.

*---But why would a high-ranking official make such a tactless statement? This would only result in losing the adventurers' cooperation...*

Shizu's concerns were echoed by the actions of a single adventurer.

"I-I'm out. I'd be knocking on death's door by taking on such a request!"

With those words, a man made an attempt to flee.

Most present naturally thought his reaction was understandable. However, the next moment, an unforeseen event occurred that none of them could have imagined.

"Please wait. I understand your frustrations very well. However, we absolutely need everyone's cooperation to defeat the demon!"

As the minister spoke, the knights guarding the door drew their swords and took up defensive positions.

"Hey, hey, looks like they're not planning to let us go..."

Next to Shizu, Cougar muttered quietly.

Someone else complained, "Are you planning to use us as bait or something?"---a sentiment that seemed to reflect the current situation accurately.

"Everyone, please calm down! It is true that the demon has been resurrected, but its whereabouts are unknown. This is regrettable for all of us. We had planned to gather capable individuals like yourselves to search for the demon, but it seems things haven't gone as smoothly as anticipated."

The tumultuous hall quieted naturally as the minister began speaking.

If they attempted to escape, they would end up making enemies of the state. To avoid that, the adventurers had no choice but to go along with the minister's plan. At the very least, they decided to hear out the discussion first.

"To tell you the truth, we have determined what the demon is targeting."

The adventurers buzzed with excitement at this revelation, but the minister continued unperturbed.

He explained that there was a sealed room in the castle's underground where a single body lay. The minister clarified that this body was the demon's physical form, and its goal was to retrieve it to achieve complete resurrection.

Shizu raised her hand, signaling a question and requesting permission to speak.

"Oh, you're the renowned Shizue Izawa, aren't you? I will answer any questions you have!"

It seemed that Shizu's reputation had reached the minister as well, and he readily granted her permission to speak.

"If this demon has brought the nation to the brink of destruction, it would seem to rival even an Archdemon in its threat. So, my question is---"

If the danger level was truly Calamity-class, the demon in question would be a terrifying entity worthy of legend. At the very least, the Silver Wings should have been able to hold their own against a Greater Demon.

Confident in her assumptions, Shizu asked her crucial question.

"---Does this demon have a name?"

![hard scene break]

The grand hall fell dead silent.

Monsters gain significantly more power upon receiving a name. This was common knowledge among adventurers of a certain level or higher. Therefore, Shizu's question held profound significance.

There were instances where a named Greater Demon could be stronger than an unnamed Archdemon. Typically, when a monster acquired a name, it evolved; a Greater Demon with a name would almost certainly evolve into an Archdemon.

The enemy this time was not a newcomer but a seasoned being who had existed for at least a hundred years, accumulating knowledge, experience, and mastery of cunning. Even if it were merely a Greater Demon, it was imperative to recognize it as a threat on par with an Archdemon. If such an opponent had a name, their threat level would be considerably higher.

While only a few adventurers possessed this level of understanding, Shizu had been meticulously educated by Demon Lord Leon. Thus, she was acutely aware of how troublesome demons that had incarnated and gained intelligence could be.

"...A name? No, there is no mention of the demon having a name."

Upon hearing that, Shizu felt a small sense of relief.

*If the demon doesn't have a name, it might not be at the level of an Archdemon. It's likely just a Greater Demon that has incarnated and increased its power.*

If that's the case, it might not be Calamity-class as feared; it could be of Hazard-class instead.

*No, that's premature thinking. If it's Hazard-class, I don't think the Silver would lose...*

There was a chance they were caught off guard, but Shizu deemed it too risky to make that assumption. For now, she took solace in the fact that the demon didn't have a name.

"That's a relief. So, Minister, do you intend to keep us here and wait for the demon to come?"

"Indeed. It was a difficult decision for our country, but now that the Silver Wings have been defeated, we have no choice but to stake our hopes on this plan. Please, understand our position!"

The minister's plan was understandable. If adventurers scattered throughout the town, the forces would be divided. There was a risk of individuals being targeted and killed, much like the Silver Wings. Keeping everyone confined within the castle seemed a prudent decision.

Yet, Shizu couldn't shake off her unease about the minister's words.

If that was the plan, it should have been communicated clearly from the start. The minister's lack of transparency raised concerns.

Even now, knights were blocking the doors, creating a situation where the adventurers had no choice but to comply with the minister's directives.

*I don't feel good about this. It seems like they see us as potential enemies instead of allies---wait, could it be?*

Shizu wondered if the minister was hiding something. His words seemed truthful, but there was a possibility he had other objectives.

That suspicion turned out to be correct.

"Don't joke around! We don't have any obligation to obey this country. Let us---"

The man who first tried to escape shouted again. Ignoring the knights standing at the door, he attempted to leave the grand hall. But in the next moment, the knight captain acted swiftly.

The adventurer was cut down with a drawn sword.

"...!"

"You struck him down! What do you think you're doing?!"

The adventurers were thrown into chaos, but the knight captain remained calm and composed.

"Silence! Before you speak out, take a good look at this man!"

With those words, the knight captain kicked the fallen adventurer.

The man lay sprawled on the floor, clutching his wound in pain in front of the adventurers. From him, a sinister shadow began to separate.

"A Lesser Demon..."

Someone's murmur echoed through the hall.

Before the shocked adventurers could fully grasp the situation, a spell from another knight caused the sinister shadow---a Lesser Demon---to vanish.

"Did you see that? The reason we isolated you here is that there might be others possessed by demons like this one. We observed suspicious behavior in this individual, but there could be more demons hiding among us. It seems the resurrected demon can summon these low-grade demons, which pose a threat in numbers. Follow our lead and cooperate quietly. If you act out of line, you'll be treated as a demon and dealt with accordingly!"

The knight captain's one-sided statement stirred a commotion in the room.

Internally, Shizu sighed, realizing that the situation had become even more complicated.

![hard scene break]

The room teetered on the edge of panic.

The only reason violence hadn't erupted was the presence of several skilled individuals. Still, the lower-ranked members, lured by the promise of high rewards, remained tense, casting wary glances around the room.

"This is bad. Those who don't know who's on their side are starting to panic."

"You're right. Even knowing who's who doesn't necessarily bring peace of mind."

Though not mentioned by the knight captain, there was also the looming threat of being overwhelmed by numbers and having one's body taken over. Unless exceptionally strong, one couldn't completely dismiss the possibility of being possessed by a demon.

In a situation like this, the only person you could trust was yourself.

The situation had reached a critical point, deepening Shizu's suspicions even further.

*They should have anticipated this from the beginning. So why create such confusion...? It was almost as if the goal was to sow paranoia.* As she reached this realization, Shizu became fearful of her own thoughts.

There were demons among the gathered adventurers. Revealing that fact caused paranoia to spread among them. What would happen next was likely a round of probing, followed by a witch hunt. Suspicious individuals might be killed before they even had a chance to explain themselves.

Cougar realized this too, and so did the other experienced, high-ranking adventurers. They understood the situation was dangerous. However, any rash actions could make them the first to be suspected. A careless remark could easily draw hostility from the adventurers.

"This is bad..."

"Yeah, in this situation, we can't afford to make any careless moves."

Cougar and Shizu exchanged quick glances, silently confirming each other's intentions. Without words, they both pondered the best course of action.

At that moment, an adventurer began to laugh.

"Kufufufu. This is interesting. Among those gathered here, there are demons. By planting that seed of doubt, you've ensured they won't form an instant bond of cooperation, correct? No matter how strong they are individually, without unity, they're vulnerable. So even well-disciplined knights can manage them with ease. Isn't that what you're suggesting?"

This adventurer had blended in seamlessly with the others, appearing as just another participant.

He had striking black hair, uncommon in this world, and was quite handsome. His robe, resembling a mage's attire, was luxurious, hinting that he wasn't in desperate need of money.

His participation was likely motivated by a desire for self-promotion, fueled by confidence in his own abilities. As evidence:

"Who's that guy?"

"Dunno. Never seen him before."

These whispers spread among the adventurers.

"Shizu-san, that guy isn't just some ordinary person..."

"Yeah. He looks like a mage, but there's no opening in his defenses. It's hard to believe someone that skilled is unknown."

Shizu's observation made Cougar nod in agreement.

The man had no noticeable presence until he began to speak, and no one had paid any attention to him before. What was his true purpose? Cougar and Shizu decided to watch quietly, remaining cautious, as events unfolded.

"What are you trying to say?"

The minister fixed a sharp gaze on the man, questioning him sternly.

In response, the man chuckled calmly, "Kufufufu. Oh, no, you see, it just seemed like this task could be accomplished more easily than I thought, so I couldn't help but laugh."

"What?"

"Earlier, you over there said, 'If you do anything strange, you'll be treated as a demon and cut down accordingly,' right? So, what are you going to do? I don't intend to follow you, nor do I plan to play along with your little charade."

"...Little charade?"

The knight captain's face reddened with anger at the man's words. He held back his fury with reason, but it was clear his restraint wouldn't last long.

Before anyone realized it, a wide space had formed around the man as everyone kept their distance, not wanting to be drawn into the confrontation. The knights then moved in, surrounding the man to corner him.

"Are you going to play innocent? You were the one who summoned the Lesser Demon, weren't you? When a demon is summoned, there's a mana connection between the summoner and the summoned demon. This is common knowledge, isn't it?"

The man's gaze was fixed on a mage who stood guarded by knights. The mage's visibly shaken reaction confirmed to Shizu that the man's accusation was true. However...

*I can't believe it. I know about the mana connection, but that's not widely known. Besides, how did he 'see' that connection?*

Humans couldn't visually perceive the flow of mana with their natural abilities. Only those highly skilled in manipulating mana might barely sense it through intuition. Yet, the man spoke of it as if it were nothing. This alone revealed his abnormality.

"Wha---You---?!"

"Are you mocking us with this nonsense?!"

The knights drew their swords, but the man remained calm and composed.

"Kufufufu. You tried to cut that man down without even verifying who he was, just because he attempted to leave this grand hall. Just because he turned out to be a demon doesn't make your actions justifiable. Perhaps you intended to brush it off naturally, but I must say, it's quite sloppy."

His tone might have seemed mocking, but his argument was sound. Shizu agreed with his reasoning, but she couldn't fully side with him. There was a sinister aura about him that unsettled her deeply. And Shizu's unease soon proved justified.

"Are you defying the state's policy?" the seething knight captain demanded.

The man replied calmly, "No."

"I wholeheartedly agree with the policy, as it saves me a lot of trouble. Regarding my order to 'subjugate the resurrected demon,' there's no restriction stating I must 'only kill demons.' It seems this country's policy aligns with that as well, so I see no reason why I should be solely criticized."

The arrogant man began to say something even more outrageous. Everyone present understood the implications of his words.

The resurrected demon was believed to be seeking its sealed body, possibly disguising itself as a human to do so. According to the country's policy, killing those deemed suspicious was justified if it helped uncover the demon.

In other words---

"Are you planning to massacre everyone here to find the demon?"

Shizu's question cut to the heart of the matter. The man had no intention of being selective in his methods.

"Correct."

With a beautiful smile, the man affirmed Shizu's suspicion.

The knights quickly moved to protect the minister, while the adventurers divided---some fled, while others prepared to confront the man. Shizu stepped forward, ready to face him directly. She couldn't allow his rampage to continue unchecked. Cougar followed her lead. He was the kind of man who wouldn't back down in a situation like this.

With the appearance of such renowned and skilled individuals, the atmosphere in the room shifted dramatically. Some were frightened, but others rallied, ready to support Shizu and Cougar.

Among those gathered, there could indeed be a demon. The adventurers believed that by watching each other, they could prevent a surprise attack from any demon.

In this tense situation, even the knights couldn't act recklessly. Interfering without cause might provoke the adventurers' wrath. Individually, they might not pose a great threat, but as a group, adventurers were a fearsome force.

Seeing the assembly before him, the man smirked smugly.

![hard scene break]

The man's true identity was that of a demon, summoned by one of the Silver Wings just before her death.

The demon chose the most straightforward means to fulfill the request. He operated without ethical considerations, adhering strictly to the contract and taking the most efficient actions.

"Who are you?" Shizu demanded.

"Yes, well, it's a name from an old acquaintance, but you can call me 'Kuro,'" the demon---Kuro---responded.

*Kuro...? I don't recall hearing that name before, but it feels familiar somehow...*

Shizu felt as though she was on the verge of recalling something, but she knew now wasn't the time to dwell on it.

"I am Shizu. I cannot condone your actions. While it's true that 'there's a magical connection between the summoned demon and the summoner,' it cannot be proven."

With that declaration, Shizu confronted Kuro directly.

Since there was no proof, Shizu couldn't definitively conclude, as Kuro suggested, that the knights' actions were staged. If they were prepared to brandish swords based on mere suspicion, Shizu had no intention of following the country's orders. But more importantly, she wasn't about to let Kuro have his way either.

"Kufufufu, how amusing. Then, I shall dispose of you first!"

With that, Kuro unleashed magic without any incantation. For Kuro, an ancient demon, using magic was as natural as breathing. A scorching mass of raging fire---Fireball---hurtled toward Shizu, but the moment it touched her, it fizzled out.

"---Hm?"

"Fire doesn't affect me."

"...I see. A high-ranking spirit, and a perfect Fusion at that. With this body, you're a bit of a nuisance. However, nothing I can't handle."

Shizu and Kuro locked eyes, and in an instant, their intense battle began.

Shizu's sword, enveloped in flames, took on the properties of a magic sword. Spirits held a natural advantage over demons, so if Kuro were to be slashed by it, he would suffer significant, perhaps even irreparable, damage.

At that moment, Kuro materialized sharp, formidable claws on both of his hands. These were his favored weapons, known as Scissor Claws. Although Kuro could easily secure victory using magic, he chose instead to engage in close combat with his weapon.

"Kufufufu, I shall indulge you for a little while."

"Don't underestimate me!"

As the battle's intensity grew, the onlookers could only watch in stunned silence.

"A-amazing..."

"S-so this is the pinnacle...the strength of a champion reigning at the top of adventurers..."

"Incredible. I guess the title Conqueror of Flames isn't just for show---"

Praises for Shizu echoed around her. With her flashy, fire-based attacks, it appeared to the onlookers that Shizu had the upper hand.

"Shizu-san..."

However, the reality was different from what it seemed. Some, like Cougar, realized this. Despite what appeared to be a physical disadvantage, it was Kuro who held the upper hand. Kuro's vast combat experience was so extensive that even with all of Shizu's abilities, she couldn't fully grasp his depth.

"...Who are you, really?"

Kuro chuckled, "Kufufufu. Should someone about to die concern themselves with that? Even if you knew, it would only lead to despair," and sneered, "That is, if you knew."

"I see. It seems you're not the type to instigate this kind of event. You're more---"

"Even so, it's a matter that doesn't concern you, does it?"

*True, it doesn't concern me,* Shizu thought. Yet, she realized that the man calling himself Kuro was too dangerous to be left unchecked. Determined, Shizu resolved to unleash her most powerful magic.

"You're too dangerous. Sorry, but I have to get serious now."

"Kufufufufu, how interesting."

Kuro remained calm and unmoved, ready to take Shizu's attack head-on.

*That composure will be your downfall.*

"I'll end this now! Inferno Flame---!"

Utilizing the full power of Ifrit and channeling all her willpower and mana, Shizu unleashed her ultimate technique. This fiery assault, the pinnacle of spirit magic, surpassed even the heat intensity of nuclear magic, Nuclear Cannon, and struck Kuro directly.

When Shizu's magic dissipated, Kuro stood there, transformed into an entirely different form. He now appeared almost human-like, yet his presence was unmistakably inhuman. Golden eyes gleamed with a crimson gleam. His skin was white as snow. The lavish robe had vanished in the flames, replaced by jet-black wings that enveloped and protected his body. He bore a striking resemblance to a Greater Demon.

"Kufufu, for a mere human to wield the power of Ifrit so masterfully... It feels like I'm truly 'fighting' again after a long time."

"A demon...? And you're unscathed after withstanding the pinnacle of spirit magic?"

"An astute observation. However, let me correct you. I'm not unscathed; I did feel some pain," Kuro said then laughed, "This is why battles are so interesting."

What was despair for Shizu was akin to a death sentence for everyone present.

"Well then, let's wrap this up, shall we?"

With that, Kuro unleashed a devastating blow. He swung his Scissor Claws with the intention of smashing Shizu's head, unapologetically.

However...

The attack was blocked, leaving not a single scratch on Shizu's mask. Not only that, but the arm that delivered the blow was blown away. For the first time, the demon known as Kuro was shaken.

"Impossible! To deflect my attack, no, that 'mask'... Could it be...that its temporal thickness...is infinite?!"

For the first time in thousands of years, Kuro was truly astonished, shaken to his core. In the face of this unbelievable situation, Kuro's interest in Shizu deepened.

*My attacks are ineffective. That 'mask' must be bound by some kind of causality. And that temporal thickness... Considering it has existed longer than I have, that 'mask' seems to transcend time. Who possesses such an artifact? Kufufufufu, this is very intriguing indeed!*

"Kufufufufu. That was more damage than I expected. Let's call it quits for now!"

With that, Kuro halted his assault on Shizu. Showing no interest in the nominal outcome, he declared his own defeat and fled from the scene. The adventurers erupted in cheers.

"As expected of the Conqueror of Flames!"

"That demon was all bark and no bite!"

Perhaps relieved at being saved, the praise for Shizu was loud and enthusiastic. Similarly, the knights, having witnessed Shizu's strength, seemed to realize that their earlier attitudes had been quite unpalatable. Seizing the opportunity that their deception had not been exposed, they schemed to sweep everything under the rug.

"W-We have no intention whatsoever of making light of the adventurers. If we can just ascertain the identity of the demon, that would be enough!"

With the minister's intervention and statement, the confusion in the room was temporarily brought under control.

And as for Shizu...

She was plagued by fatigue greater than she had anticipated. It was fortunate that Kuro withdrew. Continuing the fight would have been difficult, and Shizu knew she had no chance of winning.

*Thank goodness he withdrew. But what was that demon's objective?*

Kuro had mentioned the word "order." It was hard for Shizu to believe that someone could command such a powerful demon.

*And that strength... He faced me while still holding back. He's definitely beyond Calamity-class in terms of danger.*

At that moment, Shizu suddenly remembered. She recalled how Demon Lord Leon had warned her about the existence of demons known as primordials, among the threats he had mentioned. These nameless demons schemed to manifest in this world, identified not by names but by distinctive colors.

*Could Kuro possibly be Noir...? No way, right?*

Shizu dispelled that suspicion. After all, Demon Lord Leon had said, "That demon is particularly heretical among the primordials and very troublesome." There was no way such a figure would be here. Moreover, the idea of them being bound by someone's order was impossible, so Shizu quickly dismissed that thought.

Yet, deep in her heart, an unshakeable doubt remained.

![hard scene break]

That night. A knight visited Shizu's room.

"I apologize for the late hour. The king wishes to speak with you. I regret disturbing you when you are tired, but could you please follow me?"

Though Shizu was fatigued and wanted to rest, she knew she couldn't ignore a request from the king.

"I understand. I will get ready."

She tidied herself and decided to follow the knight. Notably, Shizu was the only one given a private room. Everyone else invited by the state was directed to large communal rooms, while the remaining guests were packed into any available lodging spaces. Given these circumstances, Shizu speculated that she was the only one summoned by the king.

*They'll probably inquire about that demon Kuro. Considering they're discussing countermeasures late into the night, even the country's leadership has a tough time,* Shizu thought.

The knight who guided Shizu was the same man who had escorted her during the day.

"Shizu-dono, your performance in the battle earlier was truly magnificent. Even that demon seemed to fear you---"

He spoke enthusiastically, but Shizu felt uncomfortable under his respectful gaze. She decided to correct him clearly.

"No, I survived because I was lucky. That demon was stronger than me."

"Here you go again with modesty. The demon lost an arm and fled quickly, didn't it? Although it was unfortunate that it escaped, as long as we have you, Shizu-dono, that demon is nothing to fear!"

The knight's youthful confidence was evident. Despite witnessing such a formidable threat, he seemed convinced they would win next time.

*Are the country's leaders properly informed? If they share this knight's perspective, they might be in serious danger next time.*

Shizu was exasperated by the thought but reminded herself that she would have the opportunity to provide the correct explanation.

*Thinking about it, I was indeed lucky,* Shizu thought, as she arrived at the room where the king awaited. It was an underground space, the most heavily guarded area in the castle. As Shizu entered the room, the heavy door closed behind her. The knight who had guided her walked further in and took a seat on one of the three chairs arranged there. The remaining two chairs were occupied by an imposing man who appeared to be the king and the minister from earlier.

"...?"

At that moment, an alarm bell rang in Shizu's mind. The situation was clearly unnatural, no matter how she looked at it. There was no one outside the door. Furthermore, it was inappropriate for the knight to sit down without first greeting the king.

*Come to think of it, I didn't see this knight in the great hall... So why does he seem to know so much about my actions, as if he witnessed them firsthand?*

Shizu, exhausted, realized that the knight had not been present during the earlier events.

"Thank you for coming, Shizu-dono. As the king, I appreciate your willingness to sacrifice yourself for the country."

"What are you saying...?"

"You're slow on the uptake, I see. You must be exhausted from the battle with the intruder, right? So now, we want you to be a sacrifice for the sake of our country's guardian, while we have the chance."

"...!"

With those words from the minister, Shizu finally understood she had been set up. The unease she had felt from the beginning made sense now. Being assigned a room isolated from other adventurers. When she considered the treatment of adventurers in the great hall, it seemed unnaturally suspicious. What if their true intention wasn't to defeat the resurrected demon, but to offer sacrifices instead?

"I see. You were in on it from the beginning, weren't you?"

"Correct."

The knight who had guided Shizu replied with a bright smile.

"My name is Orthos. I'm the national knight Orthos, hailed as a champion, and the ruler who governs this land."

"---I see now. You weren't sealed away from the beginning; you were free to act as you pleased in this land. You're not just any demon---you're an enemy of humanity, a devilkin, right?"

Upon Shizu's inquiry, Orthos grinned broadly. That sly grin was the answer itself.

It was all an elaborate hoax, a trap orchestrated by the nation. They had summoned renowned adventurers only to eliminate them, seize their equipment, and offer their bodies to demons---devilkin. In doing so, the demons gained even more power. This country was ruled by devilkin, with the king as nothing more than a puppet.

Orthos said, "Exactly. I 'saw' your battle through the minister's eyes. That demon was formidable, but its end was anticlimactic. What surprised me more was your mask. It seems to be a magic item of considerable value. That's exactly what I deserve to possess. I'll drink your blood, devour your flesh, and your power will become mine as well," and sneered, "You must be thrilled?"

*Don't mess with me*, Shizu thought.

"I won't let the likes of a devilkin run rampant! I'll crush your pathetic schemes right here!"

"Hahahaha, fool! Your wounds from the battle haven't healed, and your mana hasn't recovered. Do you really think you can defeat me in that state?!"

As Orthos said, Shizu was far from being in perfect condition. She regretted her carelessness and realized she hadn't questioned the summons from the king. Facing the worst enemy without any preparation was a fatal mistake for an adventurer like her. Now that it had come to this, escaping wouldn't be easy. Dragging out the conversation wouldn't improve her chances. Waiting until morning might bring reinforcements, but the night had only just begun.

With that in mind, Shizu decided it was better to confront Orthos than to attempt escape. Resolute, Shizu moved swiftly. Without a word, she put everything into her first strike.

"Too slow!"

Shizu's sword, wreathed in flames, lunged toward Orthos's neck. Yet, Orthos was faster. He intercepted the blade with his left arm.

"Urk!"

"Oh? To think you'd wound me. You seem stronger than the last duo I faced."

"As expected, you did kill the Silver Wings..."

"Of course. Although I admit, I was careless and allowed them to escape. I've learned from that mistake, which is why I've relocated to these underground chambers."

Previously, Orthos had lured the Silver Wings to the back garden to avoid public attention, but the Silver had managed to escape through an Outsider-Repelling Barrier. Orthos, reflecting on that blunder, chose to conduct his hunt in the underground chambers this time. Orthos knew Shizu was unlikely to escape due to this setup, which is why he chose to torment her rather than kill her outright.

Orthos, being a demon who thrived on the fear people experienced, began speaking about himself in a way designed to instill despair in Shizu. "Do you know? Even among demons, there are ranks."

"Like lesser and greater demons?"

"Yes, that's right. Above them are the legendary beings known as Archdemons."

"..."

"Ku-ku-ku, indeed. I am one of those Archdemons!"

Orthos's laughter was meant to deepen Shizu's despair. It was unfortunate that her frightened face was hidden behind the mask, but for Orthos, simply boasting about his greatness was enough to satisfy him.

Originally a mere Lesser Demon, Orthos had been fortunate enough to obtain a physical body. Upon awakening an ego, he pursued his ambitions, constantly striving for greater power. By allying with the devilkin, he gained strength and evolved into a Greater Demon. Disguised as a soldier, he infiltrated the country and eventually ascended to the rank of Archdemon by stealing a 'name.'

"Do you understand? Having artificially become a champion, the voices of the people in this country have become my strength. That strength bestowed a name upon me. With my own power, I became Named. Yes, just like that esteemed individual who stands at the pinnacle of our lineage."

"...What are you saying?"

"Ku-ku-ku, you ignorant fool, there are things you do not know. But never mind. What is clear is that even if you perform Fusion with Ifrit, your power is insufficient to defeat me!"

Orthos's declaration was accompanied by his boisterous laughter. Thus, the one-sided battle began.

Orthos pummeled Shizu with brutal punches and kicks, relishing in the violence but deliberately avoiding a fatal blow. Shizu focused desperately on defense, trying to minimize damage, but the fatigue from the earlier battle compounded her struggles. The difference in power was overwhelming. Shizu's movements grew slower.

*This is the worst. If it weren't for the battle earlier, things might have been different...* Shizu thought, but voicing such thoughts would only sound like excuses for her failure.

"Ha-ha-ha-ha! Even someone called a champion has only this much power! What's wrong? Won't you Fuse with Ifrit? If you do, maybe you'll be able to put up a slightly better fight, don't you think?" Orthos taunted and showed a malicious grin. He knew Shizu's strength was almost depleted.

Suppressing her frustration, Shizu kept her guard up, determined not to give in. There was no hope. She resolved to drag the fight out a little longer, looking for one chance to strike back. As Orthos began to gather mana in his right hand, preparing a fatal blow, Shizu allowed herself a faint smile.

*That composure is a sign of carelessness. My mana may be spent, but Ifrit's power still lingers. If I let it run wild, it could destroy even an Archdemon!*

That was Shizue's ace in the hole. She was waiting for the moment when Orthos would get too confident and let his guard down, planning for a mutual destruction. But the battle was not to end as she planned.

![hard scene break]

"How troublesome. To think that someone like you, who has caused me pain, would be killed by such trash."

A cheerful voice echoed through the chamber, halting Orthos's movements. Orthos turned towards the source of the voice. The king and the minister, confident of Orthos's victory, wore malicious smiles. Behind them, unnoticed until now, stood a handsome man dressed in jet-black attire. It was Kuro.

"Y-you are..."

In response to Shizu's involuntary murmur, Kuro gave a soft but cold smile.

"You know, I am someone who always keeps promises."

With those words, Kuro swiftly tossed several heads toward the king and the minister.

"T-these are the parasitic soldiers'---?!"

"Nonsense. My knights, who boast unparalleled strength, were killed?"

Seeing the astonished expressions of the king and the minister, Kuro declared with a bored tone, "Just because you parasitized some Lesser Demons, you think that's unparalleled strength? Your standards of strength are so low, it's hardly worth discussing."

The king and the minister were outraged by Kuro's words.

"Fool! We witnessed your strength earlier. Indeed, formidable, but still not our match!"

"Also, you think you can defeat us with just one arm---"

Splat.

Kuro was merciless toward uninteresting opponents. Without waiting for the minister to finish, he crushed his head with a single hand.

"I-impossible! The minister was protected by a Greater Demon like I am! Kuh, in that case---"

In a desperate move, the king turned his back to Kuro and hastily grabbed several weapons prepared beforehand.

"Behold! These are the numerous treasures we seized after killing champions. With these, you're nothing---"

These were the king's final words.

Whether his opponent was the king of a nation or not, Kuro did not hesitate. Like any nameless foot soldier, if they were in his way, he would simply eliminate them. The king's corpse toppled over, and numerous treasures scattered across the floor. Even if these treasures were the culmination of centuries of wrongdoing in this country, they did not pique Kuro's interest.

"Don't chirp, trash. Gathering this kind of junk to adorn fodder won't make you my enemy," he said with a mocking tone.

Shizu could hardly believe what was happening right before her eyes. The heads Kuro threw belonged to the knights of the country. From their conversation, it was clear that these knights had been possessed by demons.

*I didn't expect him to flee, but this...*

Shizue shuddered upon realizing that Kuro was hunting demons that had possessed humans. Despite being injured during their battle---his right arm still not regenerated---Kuro's face remained smug, as if the injury were of no concern.

"Fuha-hahaha! Don't think that just because you've defeated my puppets, you can compare yourself to me, an Archdemon. A coarse demon like you is nothing more---"

"Who are you calling coarse?"

The smile vanished from Kuro's face.

"Huh?"

In a blur, Kuro moved and began to strangle Orthos. To Shizu, it seemed as if Kuro had disappeared momentarily. Orthos appeared to perceive the same, letting out a foolish sound.

"*Red's* kin are too overconfident. That's why they can't accurately gauge their opponent's strength."

It was a remark Kuro made to himself, not directed at anyone in particular. However, Orthos overheard and understood its implications all too well, filling him with despair.

"N-no way... You, no, Sire..."

"Someone as disgraceful as you, who allies with devilkin, has no right to live. I will destroy your soul so that you can never resurrect."

"No, stop---?!"

There was no need to listen to Orthos's excuses. Kuro's rampage was entirely one-sided. And with that, the demons lurking within the Kingdom of Filtwood were completely eradicated.

![hard scene break]

The next day, the discovery of the king and the minister's corpses caused a commotion throughout the castle. Though the incident was hushed up, a dead demon was also found in the basement. Naturally, the first to discover it was Shizu. Shizu chose not to reveal the full truth. Instead, the official record stated that "the deaths of the king and the minister were the work of a demon known as Kuro. After a fierce battle, Shizu repelled the demon."

Kuro had proposed this deal: <If you tell this story, I will stop targeting you.>

Shizu accepted. She knew she couldn't defeat Kuro and didn't view him as merely an evil entity.

Not only Shizu but also the other adventurers were suspected as suspects. With the grave crime of regicide having occurred, it was an unavoidable situation. However, their suspicions were soon cleared when the king's and minister's wrongdoings were exposed through their remaining belongings. Remarkably, everything was hidden in a way that would ensure its immediate discovery.

*It's undoubtedly Kuro's doing.*

Shizu, caught up in the incident, was firmly convinced of that.

With the truth revealed, Shizu and the adventurers received apologies and rewards, clearing them of any wrongdoing.

Several days later.

"So in the end, who was that guy Kuro?"

"I think it's better not to know."

"...Yeah, you're right. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. Well then, I'm off; stay well, Shizu-san!"

With that, Cougar waved goodbye and walked away.

Shizue also closed the lid on that question in her heart. Shizu had her own duties, and that demon named Kuro was beyond her capabilities.

*Someone else will surely deal with that demon somehow*, she decided to optimistically hope.

Time passed.

The cracked mask fell away, revealing the face of a beautiful woman confronting a slime. It was Shizu and Rimuru. A demon laughed upon seeing this scene. It was Kuro.

"Kufufufufu. To think that mask would crack. Indeed, that slime, that great being is---"

Just then, Kuro watched as Rimuru's hand regenerated the mask.

"I knew it. Kufufufufu!"

Kuro laughed, anticipating the end of his monotonous days. He eagerly awaited the day he would be summoned by Rimuru...

Thus began the quiet, one-sided manifestation of the fateful encounter between Rimuru and Kuro, who would later be known as Diablo.
