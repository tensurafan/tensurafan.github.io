# Story 5: Coleus's Dream|Part 1

Inside a dim, dark room, a girl lay on a couch. Despite her sloppy appearance, she exuded an inexplicable elegance. The source of this allure was her beauty.

Her silver hair, flowing like moonlight in the night, glistened in the darkness. Her eyes, one blue and the other red, held a captivating, heterochromatic gleam. She looked to be around fifteen or sixteen years old, embodying a beauty that was both imperfect and perfected---a fleeting moment between girlhood and maturity.

Lost in thought, the girl unintentionally parted her lips, revealing small, gleaming white fangs. Her inhuman beauty was a clear sign that she wasn't quite human.

"---It truly bothers me. I cannot leave it like this. I must see him with my own eyes, to know for sure..."

As she absently fiddled with her neatly manicured nails, the girl made up her mind. Then, she turned her sharp gaze toward the darkness at the center of the room. There lay a coffin of ice. Within the transparent ice, a beautiful girl with flowing black hair lay naked and asleep.

The silver-haired girl stood and approached the ice coffin. When she touched the coffin with a finger, a bruise resembling a burn appeared. Ignoring it, the girl sighed.

With a gaze filled with myriad emotions, she looked at the girl encased in ice and spoke. "Rest assured. I will see that your wish is granted."

It was a declaration of resolve.

Then, the girl left the room.

![soft scene break]

After finishing the children's outdoor training, I returned from the town of Guratol to the capital of Ingracia.

It was the first class after the weekend, and as we gathered for the morning assembly, Chloe asked a question.

"Sensei, how much longer will you be staying here?"

That was a tricky question. Now that the children's issues were resolved, I didn't have a pressing reason to stay in this town. But still...

"Hmm, let's see... I did tell everyone I'd be leaving soon, but I still have some handover tasks for Tiss-sensei. And with the academy about to go on summer break..."

Though it was called a break, it was less than two weeks long. Since there were no air conditioners in this world, the academy shut down during the hottest days of summer, meaning no classes were held.

The Free Guild Headquarters had automatic doors and air conditioning, thanks to cutting-edge magical science technology. But this academy didn't have the budget for such luxuries, so each classroom relied on the students' own efforts to stay cool. In other words, they'd just be using makeshift fans.

That was the norm, but our class was different. Ryota had asked the wind spirits to provide us with a cool breeze. As a result, it was surprisingly comfortable in the summer, but there was still no reason to refuse a break. Taking a holiday in the royal capital before heading back wouldn't hurt.

*Now that I think about it, I've been working non-stop.*

There was no need to rush back anyway, and I was sure Benimaru and the others would understand if I explained.

"Aren't you thinking of slacking off anyway?" Alice cut in with a sharp remark. How did this child manage to read my mind so easily?

Even though I doubted it would work, I put on a poker face and bluffed, "No, that's not it. I was just thinking of leaving you all in Tiss-sensei's capable hands before I go back. I thought it'd be good for her to teach you a few classes before the handover."

And with that, I smoothly delivered my excuse. But it backfired.

"Hmm, that sounds fine."

"True. Tiss-sensei is kind, and unlike Rimuru-sensei, she's serious."

"Hold on, hold on."

"Ahaha, I heard from the students in Class D that her lessons are really easy to understand."

"Then, Rimuru-sensei doesn't stand a chance, huh?"

"Hey, hey?"

"It's not about winning or losing, but I'd like to attend Tiss-sensei's classes too."

Even Chloe?! Even though I brought it up myself, I somehow felt like I was losing ground.

"I-isn't fine? Even if I'm gone and you end up crying? I won't even know!"

I tried to sound confident.

"It's fine, it's fine. We'll prove we can manage just fine without you, Sensei!"

"Exactly. You're leaving soon anyway, right? So trust us more, okay?!"

The other children nodded in agreement with Kenya and Alice. It seemed like the conversation had completely derailed. At this point, there was no turning back.

"Got it. Well then, I'll do as I please during summer break. And if it puts my mind at ease, it'll be a farewell from me to all of you, okay?"

" " "Okaaaaay!" " "

*Urk*, that was a quick response. Was children's growth really this rapid? Instead of feeling happy, I found myself a little lonely.

![hard scene break]

That night. I was having a drink with Yuuki in his office. I wanted to discuss with him future arrangements, including leaving the children in Tiss-sensei's care during the summer break. I explained the situation in detail. Yuuki listened with a look of astonishment.

"So, are you really that upset about it?"

"No, not at all. I'm not upset. I don't feel lonely or anything like that; I'm just relieved."

"Ohh, is that so?"

*Yeah, it is so.*

I transformed into my slime form and averted my gaze from Yuuki. He gave me a sharp look, as if he might dig deeper, but then he sighed and changed the subject.

"Understood. You've helped me a lot, Rimuru-san, so let's go with that. I'll take care of the arrangements with Tiss-sensei. As the board chairman, I'll check her availability to look after the children during the summer break."

Though he said he'd check her availability, as chairman, it wasn't like she could refuse. In any case, the school still had work to do during the break. Since teachers were paid daily, a ten-day break would be tough for many of them.

"I'm counting on you. Well, I'm also a bit worried, so I'll probably stick around a little longer before heading back. You know, the kids might feel lonely and cry."

"I don't think that's going to happen."

"...It will, though?"

"It won't. Anyway, is that all you needed?"

I was casually brushed off. More like Yuuki, still drinking, flipped through some documents with one hand. It seemed he was reading a report, and the content appeared more serious than I had thought. At first, I thought he was pretending to work to brush me off, but as his expression gradually grew stern, I realized it wasn't just an act.

"Did something happen?" I asked.

"Yeah, well...things have gotten a bit troublesome."

"Is it related to me? If not, I feel like I'm intruding, so maybe we should wrap things up here?"

Sensing a negative vibe, I suggested this, but it turned out to be an unnecessary remark. Yuuki, who was about to respond, suddenly closed his mouth. Then, he looked at me and smiled gently. That was when I realized I'd messed up.

"Rimuru-san, you seem to have a lot of free time."

"No, I'm busy."

"You're free during the summer break, right?"

"No, no, I have to take care of the kids---"

"I'll ask Tiss-sensei to handle that, so could I ask for your advice?"

*Grr*... I wanted to refuse, but I was the one who asked for advice first.

I decided to listen, since I didn't really have a choice.

"Just advice, right? So, what's going on?"

"Actually, there's a troublesome issue brewing in the Kingdom of Coleus, which borders the Kingdom of Ingracia. It started as a domestic matter, so we were just observing quietly, but it seems we can't stay passive any longer---"

The Kingdom of Coleus was a nation located west of the Kingdom of Ingracia and south of the Holy Empire of Lubelius. It bordered both great powers, with a vast, barren desert to its west. It was a member of the Council of the West but wasn't particularly enthusiastic about diplomacy. This might be why trade was minimal, and not much information flowed from there. In terms of national scale, it ranked in the lower tier of the upper-ranked countries. It was not a great power per se, but it held a respectable position.

A notable feature was their complete acceptance of the Freemen. They welcomed wandering Freemen as citizens without discrimination, resulting in a population exceeding 20 million. Many adventurers gathered there to hunt monsters from the desert, giving the Free Guild a high status. However, a major incident had occurred, shaking the very foundation of the kingdom.

"In short, it's the struggle for the throne," Yuuki began to speak. "The conflict is between His Highness Sauzer Coleus, the eldest brother and appointed crown prince, and His Highness Aslan Coleus, the younger prince born to the king's concubine. There are other siblings, but they're distancing themselves to avoid getting involved. Crown Prince Sauzer, born to the queen, has strong support from the nobles. In contrast, Prince Aslan's mother is a low-status woman from the Hot Sand People. Normally, this wouldn't even be a contest, but here's where the problem lies..."

Yuuki hesitated to continue. It seemed that this problem was also affecting the current troublesome situation.

"What kind of problem?" I asked.

Yuuki looked at me hesitantly.

"When I think about it calmly, this is a major issue. Even though it's you, Rimuru-san, I can't talk about it without some guarantee that you'll help."

I nodded in agreement. I was only intending to offer some advice, but getting involved in a succession dispute of some kingdom wasn't really my business. Even a child would know it's foolish to stick your neck into such risky matters.

"Yeah, you're right. I was definitely being a bit too curious myself."

I was about to say, "Let's just forget about it," but as soon as Yuuki heard that, he smirked.

*Hm?* I thought to myself, but I realized it too late.

"Is that so? It's reassuring to hear you say that!"

"Huh?"

"Actually, His Highness Aslan is an A rank adventurer!"

"Ah!"

"Not just in his own country, but also in the surrounding nations, he's a renowned champion, often called the Prince of the Hot Sands. As such, he's someone the Free Guild can't afford to ignore."

"What are you casually saying? I have no intention of listening---"

"Isn't it obvious? Since you kindly agreed to help, Rimuru-san, I'll provide you with all the information!"

*This guy, he set me up! He's been putting on a blatant act this whole time just to drag me into this...But now that I've heard all this, it seems difficult to keep insisting I'm not involved.*

While thinking that, I asked to be sure: "By the way, what happens if I refuse to cooperate?"

"It is a no-brainer. Unfortunately, to prevent information leaks, you'll have to stay here until this issue is resolved. Of course, I'll provide paper, so feel free to print out as many manga as you like to pass the time."

What a sly guy. He was maneuvering things so that even if I refused to cooperate, he'd still benefit, though my cooperation would obviously be preferable. Indeed, consolidating the Free Guild in just a few years, Yuuki had proven himself to be a shrewd man with no shortage of cunning.

*Now, what should I do? I didn't like either option, but it seemed better to cooperate and solve the case than to be confined here. At least cooperating would likely lead to a resolution.*

With that thought in mind, I reluctantly spoke up. "I understand. I'll cooperate."

"I knew you'd say that, Rimuru-san."

With a dubious smile, Yuuki nodded at me. Feeling defeated, I decided to listen to the details anyway.

![hard scene break]

As he poured a fresh drink into his cup, Yuuki continued his explanation. "As I mentioned, Prince Aslan is an A rank adventurer. His charisma is real---he's already gained the loyalty of the Guildmaster in the Kingdom of Coleus. And now, the Free Guild there has rebelled. They've declared independence from the Free Guild headquarters and aligned themselves with Prince Aslan."

"Is such a move even possible?"

"While I'd like to say they're free to declare whatever they want, allowing this would undermine the very foundation of the Free Guild. It goes against the spirit of mutual aid and would face significant backlash from members and adventurers alike. Unfortunately, the ringleader's popularity is extraordinarily high this time, which complicates matters..."

"Ah, I see. So it's like the Free Guild members and adventurers have voluntarily decided to cooperate with him, huh?"

"Exactly."

Yuuki grimaced as he drank from his cup, making me want to join him. This was indeed a domestic issue for the Kingdom of Coleus, but it had turned into a serious situation.

"What's been the response from the Free Guild branches in the surrounding countries?" I asked.

"They're waiting and watching. It's fortunate that the branches haven't aligned with them, but some people are scheming to make a name for themselves and secure prominent positions in the Kingdom of Coleus. We can't leave this situation unattended."

"Yeah, that makes sense."

"Yes. Allowing this would undermine the headquarters' credibility and could lead to major trust issues."

"If that happens, things will spiral out of control."

"It would be utter chaos. The organization is still young, and if it starts to crumble, it'll fall apart very quickly," Yuuki agreed, his expression serious.

This was truly troublesome. As the leader of the organization, he couldn't possibly cater to every whim of each branch.

"Why not intervene directly from headquarters?" I asked.

"That's not possible," Yuuki replied. "The Kingdom of Coleus is a member state of the Council, which gives them the authority to issue orders to the Free Guild through the Council. If they say not to intervene, we have no veto power."

"Hey, hey... In that case, could you order the surrounding Free Guild branches to halt logistics?" I suggested, thinking that even if we couldn't stop merchants unaffiliated with the Free Guild, those who belonged to it might comply. But I was being naive.

"It's impossible. Didn't I mention earlier that the Kingdom of Coleus has minimal trade?"

*Oh, that's right.*

"Besides," Yuuki continued, "even if we were to restrict merchant activities, we'd need to provide them with assurances. We don't have the budget for that."

Understanding this, I felt a wave of frustration. It seemed my amateurish ideas had already been considered and dismissed long ago. So why did he ask for my help in the first place?

"It sounds like there aren't many viable options," I said, "but what do you plan to do? Or rather, what do you expect from me?"

Yuuki shrugged. "I was hoping you might come up with a solution that hadn't occurred to me."

"Sorry, I'm not much help."

"No, no. Honestly, I'm aware it's a bit of a stretch, so it's not on you, Rimuru-san."

Seeing my wry smile, Yuuki looked genuinely apologetic and bowed his head. He seemed truly troubled, with no ill intent.

"As a solution, we've concluded that infiltration and covert operations within the Kingdom of Coleus are our best options. So, what I'd like to ask of you, Rimuru-san, is..."

"If you're suggesting I assassinate Prince Aslan, I'm afraid I'll have to decline," I interrupted, understanding where this might be heading. Meddling in another country's affairs was risky, and as the chancellor of the Monster Country, it could easily escalate into an international incident.

Of course, if my identity remained hidden, it would be manageable. But an assassination was a different matter entirely---ethically unacceptable and against my conscience. Therefore, I must decline such a job.

Understanding my sentiments, Yuuki smiled wryly. "Ahaha, I wouldn't burden you with dirty work like that, Rimuru-san. Of course, running an organization isn't all clean business; we do consider clandestine actions as a last resort. But frankly, there aren't many people skilled enough to assassinate Prince Aslan."

Prince Aslan was an A rank adventurer, and one of the top-tier within that rank. Frankly speaking, he was said to be on par with, or perhaps even more powerful than, Shizu-san.

"Is he really that strong?"

"Yes. He's effectively in the Special A rank. That's why he has such rizz."

"Then, if someone were to try to deal with him in secret..."

"It would certainly be discovered. While it might be possible to kill him, it would definitely escalate into a major issue. The number of casualties would be uncertain, and the risk of failure is high. It's a method I would never choose."

I felt a sense of relief hearing that. In the first place, even though there were several A rank adventurers in the Free Guild, it was unlikely that anyone would agree to assist in assassinating Prince Aslan. Reflecting on it, this seemed natural. Taking down someone with such strength and renown, especially a champion figure, would involve extraordinary consequences.

"Making such a request would undermine my own credibility," Yuuki said with a bitter smile.

If that was the case, what exactly was the nature of the request?

"Sorry for interrupting. So, what is it that you want me to do?"

"I'd like to ask for your help in supporting a certain adventurer," Yuuki said. "His name is Paulo. He's quite skilled, though still relatively unknown. A few days ago, he took the A rank promotion exam, and I'm considering approving his promotion."

"Hmm."

"I want you to work with Paulo to infiltrate the Kingdom of Coleus and gather information on both factions."

"Just gathering information?"

"Yes, that's right. In such investigations, working alone might attract attention. Plus, being an A rank adventurer with a known reputation could raise suspicions. So, I'm looking for someone skilled yet inconspicuous."

Well, officially I was only B-plus in rank. So, in terms of not being widely known, Yuuki's point made sense.

"I see. What kind of person is this Paulo?"

"He's a young man from the countryside, so dealing with intricate schemes might be challenging for him. I don't think he can handle negotiations with nobles well, so I was thinking of having him infiltrate Aslan's faction to gather information."

"So, I should infiltrate Crown Prince Sauzer's faction, right?"

"If you can manage that, it would be ideal. At the very least, gathering rumors and gossip could provide insight into which side to support."

I felt relieved to hear that. I wasn't good at negotiating with nobles either. At any rate, Yuuki was certainly cautious. He was not only considering military strength but also evaluating the principles and legitimacy of each faction to determine which one to support.

"Hmm, I see... So, depending on the situation, you're considering teaming up with Prince Aslan as well?"

"That's correct. It's unfortunate they declared independence, but I'm considering that possibility. If they eventually rejoin the Guild, it would restore our credibility. I've judged that this would be more beneficial than imposing sanctions."

"If you determine that Crown Prince Sauzer has legitimacy?"

"In that case, I would openly ally with Crown Prince Sauzer and aim to overthrow Prince Aslan. Of course, the potential consequences of losing such a gamble would be severe, so it's a matter that requires careful consideration."

That made sense. He was not just siding with whoever seemed likely to win, so I really respected that.

"So, I should gather the evidence for your assessment?"

"Rimuru-san, you're skilled in disguises, right? Gathering information should be right up your alley," Yuuki said with a smirk, provoking me.

Well, I did enjoy spy movies and had always admired detectives, so the idea did sound intriguing. If I used my skills effectively, investigating the situation shouldn't be a problem, so it wouldn't hurt taking that role.

"Got it. I'd be reluctant for a long-term assignment, but gathering information shouldn't take too long. If it's just during the school's summer break, I can take on the task."

"That works for me. I'll discuss it with Tiss-sensei tomorrow, so please focus on the mission!"

Yuuki seemed pleased with my agreement. Although I wasn't sure how much I could contribute, I decided to give it my best effort.

![hard scene break]

The next day, Yuuki visited the school as the board chairman and discussed the summer vacation classes with Tiss-sensei.

"Instead of Rimuru-sensei, I'd like you to take over the S class, Tiss-sensei. Before the formal handover, please conduct several classes. The children trust you, so it should be fine to entrust it to you, right?"

"Yes! It's a great opportunity, so I'd be happy to take care of it."

Tiss-sensei nodded with a bright smile. Perhaps gaining confidence from the recent outdoor training, her expression was bright.

"By the way, what are your plans, Rimuru-sensei?"

The one who interjected was Jeff-sensei. This guy saw me as his rival, as always. But well, it didn't matter this time.

"Well, you know, since it's a great opportunity, I'm thinking of doing some sightseeing. I've been taking care of the S class all this time and haven't been able to take a proper break even on holidays."

Well, half of that was true, and half was a lie. I actually relaxed quite a bit on my days off, and I made sure to take breaks. Since I didn't need sleep, I always managed to carve out time for myself. That aside, the part about sightseeing is a lie.

*It can't be helped; I can't tell the truth about this one.* Just when I thought that, Jeff-sensei said something unexpected.

"If that's the case, could you spare some time this afternoon?"

Hm? I thought it was his usual snide remark, but what was going on?

"I'm leaving on a journey starting tomorrow, so I thought I should get ready..."

I said trying to avoid giving a direct answer. At that moment, Jeff-sensei flashed a confident smile and said something that made me uneasy.

"In that case, how about visiting the Kingdom of Coleus? Although it's close to the desert and known to be hot, it's surprisingly comfortable in midsummer. The nights get chilly, so it's well-known among the nobility as a summer retreat."

"He-hehhh... Is that so..."

"I don't know where you plan to relax, Rimuru-sensei, but I have connections in the Kingdom of Coleus. I owe you for treating my sister's illness, so if you have the time, I can write a letter of introduction for you."

Whether it was coincidence or if he knew something, I couldn't read Jeff-sensei's expression. He seemed genuinely noble at that moment, and I reconsidered my opinion of him.

When I glanced at Yuuki, he was also smiling.

"That sounds great! In that case, Rimuru-san, why not take up Jeff-sensei's offer?"

Yuuki, with an innocent look that seemed to say, "You didn't have a destination in mind anyway, right?" casually remarked. Whatever Jeff-sensei's intentions were, at this point, I had no choice but to go along with it.

"If that's the case, then I appreciate it. No, I'm really looking forward to it!"

"Hahaha, I'm delighted to be of service. Well then, after lunch, I'll guide you to my residence."

With those words, Jeff-sensei left for his class.

![hard scene break]

The three of us---Yuuki, Tiss-sensei, and I---briefed the children on the changes. Since it was so soon after yesterday's announcement, the kids were still trying to act nonchalant.

"Heh, we're totally fine without Rimuru-sensei."

"Yeah, just make sure you enjoy your vacation to the fullest!"

"We're really looking forward to Tiss-sensei's classes!"

Grr... These guys were taking this opportunity to rub it in.

"I-I really liked Rimuru-sensei's classes, but even you need a break." Chloe comforted me.

"Take care, Sensei."

*Gale, I won't forget your kindness.*

"Then, Rimuru-sensei, leave the rest to me!" Tiss-sensei said with a reassuring smile.

With that, we parted ways. I planned to hold a farewell party when I returned. Afterward, Yuuki and I left the academy and visited Jeff-sensei's residence.

"I apologize for the wait. Let's prepare the introduction letter now. My relative is married into the Kingdom of Coleus, so they should be able to accommodate you. What name should I put on it?"

"Huh?"

"Oh, are you pretending to be clueless? Do you plan to conduct an undercover investigation while keeping the name Rimuru?"

*Hey, hey, we're totally busted.*

"As expected of Jeff-sensei. How did you figure it out?"

Yuuki asked, and Jeff-sensei replied with a hint of irritation, "I'd appreciate it if the chairman didn't mock me as well."

"I've looked into Rimuru-sensei's background. My best subordinates couldn't find anything beyond the Kingdom of Blumund. But around the same time, a monster nation emerged in the Great Forest of Jura. Doesn't it seem unreasonable to think these events are unrelated?"

"Y-you're sharp," I said.

"Hahhh, that's the problem. Even if I'm right, you should have pretended not to know. If you don't admit it, it stays as mere speculation, and you can avoid the issue altogether. But maybe that's what makes you who you are, Rimuru-sensei. It might not be very noble, but I find it rather admirable."

"Oh, really? I thought you disliked me..."

"Hmph! There's no reason to dislike someone who saved my sister. Anyway, let's move on. The important thing is that you have many openings, Rimuru-sensei."

It was an unexpected comment, but Yuuki seemed to agree. When I glanced sideways, I noticed him nodding in agreement with Jeff-sensei. I thought to myself, *Good grief*, and then said, "I'll be more careful from now on."

"Yes, please do. Even nobles like me, who have distanced themselves from the political world, find this level of investigation simple. Keep that in mind. Even if you're outstanding as an adventurer, that alone won't get you through life. So, what will your false name be?"

Jeff-sensei sat at his desk, writing the introduction letter as he offered this advice. I had thought of him as just a disagreeable person, but it seemed I had misunderstood. I reflected on his words and began considering what false name to use.

As Jeff-sensei suggested, using a false name seemed like the better option. Even though Rimuru, as a B-plus adventurer, wasn't widely known, if it were discovered that I was the ruler of the monster nation, it could lead to major complications.

If that was the case...

"Then, Satoru."

"Satoru? Hmph, let's go with that. Here, the introduction letter is ready." Jeff-sensei handed me the letter.

"Thank you."

"This is just a token of appreciation, so please don't worry about it. My relative is Marquis Jahil, a noble in the Kingdom of Coleus. He should be able to provide you food and lodging for about two weeks. Understand, Rimuru-sensei? The introduction I'm making is for a teacher named 'Rimuru.' I've noted that you are a B-plus adventurer and also my benefactor."

"Not under my false name?"

"Of course. It means that any investigation conducted by someone of unknown identity like Satoru is not within my or Marquis Jahil's concern. You should be able to enter the country using your adventurer's credentials, so proceed confidently to the Marquis's estate. I've also noted that you should not be hindered in your actions, so feel free to do as you please. However---"

"I'll act as Satoru while out to avoid causing any trouble for the Marquis."

"Very well." Jeff-sensei nodded in agreement.

"Shall we prepare identification for Satoru as well?" Yuuki suggested. "It might be wise to have a disguise while we're at it."

Yuuki seemed to agree with the idea of using a false name. I accepted the offer and received a guild card under the name "Satoru."

![hard scene break]

After obtaining the introduction letter and identification, Yuuki led me to a tavern. It was a place where the second and third floors served as an inn, popular among mid-level and higher adventurers. The tavern was cleaner than I had expected. Since it was frequented by those with money, it seemed well-maintained.

Yuuki headed straight to a table in the back where a slender yet muscular man with a trademark spiked short hair was seated. He was wearing light leather armor protecting his torso and had metal fittings on his hands and knees. He had chest-protecting armor beside him, but no weapon in sight. Upon closer inspection, the base of his gloves was metal-plated. It seemed this man was the type to fight bare-handed

"Hey there! Sorry to keep you waiting, Paulo."

With Yuuki's greeting, it became clear that the man was Paulo. Since I was supposed to support him, I decided to observe his character and demeanor closely.

Paulo stood up in surprise and exclaimed, "Guild Master! Did you come all this way just for me?"

While his reaction might have seemed exaggerated, it was a typical response. Though friendly from my perspective, Yuuki was a prominent figure.

"Hahaha, of course. Paulo, you performed exceptionally well in the assessment. Your skills clearly rank you as an A rank adventurer."

"Oohhh, thank you so much!"

"But, you see..."

"Is there a problem?"

"No, your combat skills were impressive, but I'm wondering how they translate in real battles."

"Real...battles?"

"Yeah. I have a task for you, and I'll evaluate your performance based on the results."

As I was thinking that it might be better to let Yuuki take the lead in conversations in front of Paulo, that very conversation was unfolding. *Paulo-san, you're being deceived, you know?* Paulo seemed completely caught up in Yuuki's pace, making me want to interject and point it out.

"I-I see..."

Leaving behind the bewildered Paulo, Yuuki ordered drinks and food, then gestured for both Paulo and me to sit down.

"May I know who this person is?"

"Oh, I haven't introduced him yet, have I? This is Rimuru-san, my benefactor. He's a B-plus rank adventurer, and I've asked him to assist you with this mission."

Yuuki introduced me as his benefactor. It seemed that meant I wouldn't have to speak formally or use honorifics.

"Nice to meet you, I'm Rimuru," I greeted him with a smile.

"I'm Paulo. I'm an A- rank in the Extermination Division and currently attempting my third trial."

Paulo nodded and introduced himself as well. At first glance, he didn't seem pretentious; rather, he came across as straightforward.

"I'm also technically part of the Extermination Division."

"Hahaha, yes, Rimuru-san was promoted through a request to collect Baffledils. But you know, Paulo, his skills are definitely reliable, so you can trust him."

"If someone is recognized by you, Grandmaster, I wouldn't doubt their abilities."

With the introductions out of the way, alcohol and dishes arrived. Ingracia had developed significantly, with flavors comparable to those from my past life. The beer, served cold, had a slightly strong bitterness but was quite tasty. The only drawback was the limited variety, but complaining about it seemed like it would bring bad luck.

We clinked our wooden tankards together and toasted. As we settled back, Paulo began to speak. "So, about what we were discussing earlier---could you tell me more about this request?"

He seemed quite concerned, aware that his promotion was at stake. He also appeared to realize my involvement in the request, as his gaze flickered toward me intermittently.

"Of course," Yuuki replied, then started explaining the details to Paulo as we enjoyed our meal.

![hard scene break]

I became concerned about the possibility of information leakage, but Yuuki, commanding a formidable group of seasoned experts, reassured me. Without me noticing, a soundproofing spell had been activated. This curious magic prevented conversations from being overheard by others nearby but allowed orders to be heard clearly.

<<Report. This is the elemental magic: Airflow Shut. It was not activated by Individual: Yuuki Kagurazaka but by the person on the other side of the counter.>>

Ah, now that I thought about it, Yuuki couldn't use magic. So, this must be a place secured by the Free Guild specifically for confidential discussions. *I see it now*. Impressed by how far Yuuki's influence extended, I decided to listen carefully to his explanation.

The explanation was consistent with what I had already been told, and Paulo seemed to accept it readily. As soon as the explanation was complete, Paulo nodded vigorously.

"Got it. My job is to find out what this Aslan guy is planning, right?!"

Despite showing respect towards Yuuki, Paulo referred to Aslan, a prince of a country, without any honorifics. It seemed Paulo had a surprisingly rough edge to him. Yuuki seemed to notice this too, and with a wry smile, he pointed it out.

"That's right, but remember, you're dealing with royalty. Show more respect, or you'll find it difficult to get close."

"I-I see. Understood, Yuuki-san."

Paulo nodded firmly, though I wondered if it would be enough. Yuuki must have thought the same thing because he shrugged at me.

"Rimuru-san, Paulo is like this, so I'd appreciate any advice you can give him."

"O-okay."

Though I agreed about the concern for Paulo, I wasn't particularly skilled in undercover investigations myself. In fact, I had never done anything like that before. Just because someone enjoyed spy movies didn't necessarily mean they were adept at them.

"Didn't you say you're Rimuru or something? I trust you since Yuuki-san introduced you. Well, I'm counting on you!" Paulo said pompously.

"I'm supposed to be the support guy, right?"

"What are you talking about? Paulo handles combat, and you are in charge of strategy, Rimuru-san."

"No, no, no. Normally, it would make sense for Paulo to take the lead!"

"Yeah, Rimuru. I'm not great with details. I'll follow your lead, so help me become A rank, alright?"

*He's quite laid-back, isn't he? Well, that's alright, but...*

"A rank" referred to those who had attempted the A rank exam several times and were judged to have skills close to A rank. Officially, they were considered equivalent to B-plus rank, with no official hierarchy between them. In terms of recognized abilities, there was no doubt Paulo was superior. If we undertook the same mission, it would naturally make sense for him to take the lead. Yet somehow, I ended up being appointed as the person in charge.

![hard scene break]

*Well, que sera, sera*---with that mindset, the two of us prepared and departed from Ingracia. However, a major problem soon emerged. It turned out that Paulo was even less capable than I had anticipated. I also had to arrange the transportation to reach our destination, the country of Coleus. Taking a shared carriage would take over a week, and we couldn't afford to spend that much time. So, I decided to pull out all the stops and make the necessary arrangements.

The carriage I had used to travel to Ingracia was given to Kaval's party, and the camper van was now being used by the children as a donation to the academy. So, I decided to modify the prototype two-seater for our use. Naturally, Ranga would be pulling it. I was impressed by Paulo, who boarded with a nonchalant look, thinking he was a bigger deal than I had imagined. Normally, I'd be more critical, but I found myself reassessing Paulo a bit.

"My lord, it seems we're nearing the next country!" Ranga announced as he pulled the carriage along.

With the increasing number of travelers passing by, I figured we would arrive soon.

"Got it, thanks. Let's put away the carriage and proceed on foot," I said, waking up the dozing Paulo beside me.

"Hrmmm, are we already there?"

"Not yet. From here, we'll walk toward the town."

"Such a hassle. Can't we just go in like this?"

"Of course not! Ranga would stand out because he's a monster."

"That's right, human. Make sure you don't cause trouble for my lord!"

"Y-yeah, got it."

Paulo turned out to be quite hopeless. Seeing him being scolded even by Ranga made me want to hit myself for my earlier admiration of him as a significant figure.

"By the way, I thought this dog was unusually big, but did it just talk now?"

*Yeah he talks!*

Wait, didn't I just explain that he was a monster?! I sighed deeply in exasperation. Ranga fell silent too, looking at me with a troubled expression. I shook my head and decided to stop worrying about Paulo. Things only got more challenging once we entered the town. We decided to stay at an inn, where yet another difficult truth came to light.

"Oh, this inn looks pretty good. By the way, Rimuru, are we okay on money?"

"Huh?"

Hey hey, wait a minute, could it be...?

"Paulo-san, just to let you know---"

"What is it?"

"We're getting separate rooms, so we'll be paying separately too."

"Wait a minute. Rimuru-san, you're supposed to be looking after me on Yuuki's behalf, right?"

"Support and a bit of looking out, sure, but not paying for you!"

I wanted to say, "Cut it out already."

I'd been saving up my teaching salary bit by bit, building up my nest egg. It was hard to accept spending most of it on someone who was practically a stranger.

"That's not the point. It's not something to brag about, but I don't have money."

No, that wasn't the conversation we were having. Like at all.

"Are you kidding me?! You're supposed to be a provisional A-minus rank, a top-notch adventurer. How come you're broke?"

It was strange for someone considered top-notch even at B rank to be struggling with money. While there were exceptions like Kaval's party, the idea of him being completely broke was hard to fathom.

"Hahaha," Paulo laughed loudly, unfazed by the situation. "Don't be so angry. Honestly, in a big city like Ingracia, I get a bit carried away. I spent all my money during the break between exams."

*Man, this guy...* Paulo's standing in my eyes took a nosedive. Complaining to him wouldn't solve anything, so despite my frustration, I had no choice but to cover for him this time. I negotiated with the innkeeper and managed to get Paulo into the cheapest room available.

![hard scene break]

And so, we continued our journey westward. After staying two nights at our next stop, we expected to reach our destination by evening on the third day.

"Listen, Paulo. Tonight is different from last night. We're staying at a noble's mansion, so be on your best behavior."

"Got it, Rimuru-san."

As you could tell from this exchange, the roles between me and Paulo had completely reversed. Having reached my limit of tolerance, my usually gentle self finally took action against Paulo. I couldn't get through to him, even after explaining things gently. I mean, this guy tried to take on a monster bare-handed.

.........

......

...

That was the story from this morning. Thanks to Ranga, we managed to enter the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Coleus earlier than planned.

The scenery changed, and the temperature rose. The landscape began to resemble the Silk Road from my past life. We passed through grasslands and encountered rugged terrain with rocky mountains ahead. Continuing like this, we'd soon enter the desert area.

The Kingdom of Coleus is also known as the Kingdom of Hot Sands, so we made sure to prepare accordingly in the town where we stayed. Paulo, being lightly dressed, was fine, but I changed into summer clothes and got a white hood to protect myself from the direct sunlight.

To be honest, I didn't really need it, but I bought it to hide the unnaturalness of my appearance. It was quite pricey, so it felt wasteful to get one for Paulo, but I thought it wouldn't be mature to only get one for myself, so I reluctantly bought two. I planned to later collect reimbursement from Yuuki for it.

While I was immersed in a nostalgic mood and enjoying the scenery, I realized I had let my guard down a bit too much. Naturally, security had also gotten worse.

The main road felt more like a trade route trodden by travelers. There were patrolling soldiers, but they weren't stationed permanently, so if you were unlucky, you might encounter bandits, smugglers, or monsters.

Merchants typically hired adventurers for protection as a countermeasure. In our case, it went without saying that we had to handle it ourselves.

And yet...

"I am Paulo the 'Bare Fist.' If you value your life, leave quietly!"

Watching Paulo boast like that, I couldn't help but feel perplexed. As part of our division of roles, Paulo handled combat. While I was a bit concerned that he didn't carry any weapons, I was impressed and a bit intimidated by his style of fighting bare-handed, especially against monsters. However, this wasn't quite the same scenario.

If the opponent were just thieves, I might have stayed silent and let Paulo handle it. But this wasn't the case.

<<Report: It is B-plus rank equivalent to the Evil Centipede. Beware, however, that its body surface is covered in highly acidic venom, so be careful of splashes during physical attacks.>>

The creature that appeared was a poison lizard - a vicious monster with a powerful poison covering its body. It was no threat to me, but to Paulo, it was a formidable opponent. It should have been crystal clear, even to him, what would happen if he hit such a creature with his bare hands.

"Hey, Paulo-san. That thing is very pois---"

"Rimuru, don't worry. I'll show you what I'm capable of! Die, you monster! Knuckle Rush---!!"

*He done did it!*

This idiot ignored my advice completely and launched his attack. I couldn't help but think, *Is he acoustic?*

The result was, of course---

"Guaaaaah, my eyes! My face feels hot!"

Paulo was thrashing around, having been splashed with the Poison Lizard's bodily fluid---vicious poison.

I was also speechless at the painfully obvious outcome.

*At least, the Poison Lizard did die, though. The Knuckle Rush is more powerful than I thought, so I have to reassess that. But still, if you end up seriously injuring yourself too, then it is all meaningless!*

I took a deep breath. I had many thoughts racing through my mind, but leaving things as they were would be bad. Paulo's face was badly burned, and he was at risk of losing his sight. I had no choice but to heal him with a full potion.

"Sit."

"Th-thanks, Rimuru. I owe you one."

"I said you to sit down!"

*Do a seiza, seiza!*

I intimidated Paulo, who was just standing there.

"Grrrr. My master commands it: human, sit down."

Ranga joined in to intimidate as well.

Paulo, who didn't know what seiza was, was overwhelmed by our insistence and sat down on the spot.

*Well, whatever*. I took the opportunity to lecture him seriously. "Don't be reckless. Focus on what you can do effectively!"

After making Paulo aware of his recklessness, I took a closer look at his situation.

Mainly concerning his combat style, Paulo excelled in unarmed combat and staff techniques, but when I suggested he use a weapon, I discovered he only had a wooden stick---which had broken. He'd been fighting with just his fists ever since. When I asked if he had bought a new one, he said he didn't think it was necessary. I was astounded.

I thought it was unacceptable for someone who prided themselves on being a combat professional to not have a variety of combat options against monsters.

"You know, this is a big service I'm doing for you..."

I really didn't feel any guardian responsibility for him, but I couldn't help feeling sorry for leaving him in such a predicament. Despite Paulo's lack of foresight, he wasn't a bad person. Over these three days, I had started to feel some sympathy for him.

So, I took some magisteel from my Stomach and made a weapon specifically for Paulo. It was a six-foot long staff, about his height. It resembled the magic staff wielded by Sun Wukong, perhaps because this setting was reminiscent of the world of *Journey to the West*, but unlike that legendary weapon, it didn't change size at will, so it required careful handling.

The staff had a diameter of about three centimeters and was reasonably heavy. However, Paulo handled it with ease, swinging it around effortlessly.

"Wow, this is awesome!" Paulo exclaimed as he demonstrated his own style with great joy.

He did look quite impressive. Being made of magisteel, the staff was incredibly strong and should complement Paulo's Battlewill well, making it a formidable weapon.

I also gave him a healing potion. With this, as long as he didn't suffer instant death, he should be fine.

"Use it carefully."

"Got it, Rimuru-san!"

And so, I found myself growing closer to Paulo than I had initially anticipated.

.........

......

...

Since Paulo started listening to my advice, I felt a bit relieved. Jeff-sensei had introduced me kindly, so I couldn't overlook any rudeness or ingratitude.

As I emphasized this to Paulo, Ranga continued running. The atmosphere shifted once again.

"We've entered the desert," I observed.

"It seems so," Ranga agreed.

Ahead, traveling by carriage was no longer feasible. Ranga could create footholds in the air with his special skill, Wind Manipulation, allowing him to navigate the desert terrain. So, we switched to a makeshift sled.

The sled had two seats---one for me at the front and one for Paulo in the back. Although we couldn't carry luggage, this setup was advantageous since we didn't have to worry about it.

"Go, Ranga!" I commanded.

"Understood!" Ranga replied, picking up speed across the sand.

Much sooner than anticipated, we saw the capital of the Kingdom of Coleus, Herbaria, in the distance. I kept Ranga in the shadows as we entered the city through the outer walls.

At the checkpoint, our identities were verified. Once the soldiers realized we were high-ranking adventurers, their attitude changed. One of them took the introduction letter and quickly went to relay the message.

We were informed that a carriage would soon arrive to pick us up, and we were escorted to a waiting room. The treatment was quite satisfactory.

After waiting for just under twenty minutes, we were guided by the arriving escort and reached our destination.
