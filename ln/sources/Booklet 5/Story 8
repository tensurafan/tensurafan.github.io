# Story 8: Coleus's Dream|Part 4

"Haaaaaa-ha-ha-ha!! What a shame, what a shame. We were so close to enjoying the greatest spectacle by those fools. Did you say you're Satoru? Thanks to you, uncultured swine, our plans are ruined."

Leaning against the guild building's wall, the slender, gentle-looking man laughed. He wore a ring with a purple gem embedded in it. His skin was tan, though less sun-kissed than most. Half of his face was obscured by pale purple hair, but his lips were twisted into a sneer. Without any intention to deceive, he laughed openly at those who had fallen into his traps.

It irritated me. Calling me uncultured? This man could only write trivial scripts for third-rate plays, yet he acted so superior.

However...

"Karl!"

"You dare show yourself so brazenly. Don't think you'll get away unscathed!"

The subordinates of both princes surrounded Karl, but he remained relaxed and composed. That was to be expected.

"Hmph, mere small fry. You dare to boast so arrogantly, yet you're only worthy of dancing on my stage."

"You!" A loud noise echoed, followed by a shockwave that seemed to shake the air. Crown Prince Sauzer struck Karl. However, to everyone's surprise, Karl was unharmed. After Sauzer withdrew his fist, Karl's distorted face returned to normal. Not a drop of blood was shed, nor did he show any signs of damage. Sauzer, who concealed an incredible amount of magicules even from my perspective, looked shocked. It was clear he hadn't held back.

*This is bad*, I thought.

"Gustaaav! If we kill these guys, will it affect the plan?" Karl asked, looking into the empty sky. It was now clear Gustav was in on it too, but we had to survive this situation first to use that information.

In response to Karl's call, space began to distort---a sign of Spatial Transportation.

"My, my, weren't we instructed to keep a low profile? And now we find ourselves having to act. No choice. Let's finish this quickly and eliminate any evidence."

"Gustav, so you were involved too!"

"Hmm, you were an excellent pawn for me, but it's time to take back that power of yours." As Gustav spoke, the meaning of his words became evident. Crown Prince Sauzer's presence diminished rapidly.

<<Report. Individual: Sauzer has experienced a rapid decrease in contained magicules. Simultaneously, individual: Gustav has shown a significant increase in magicules.>>

It was a transfer of power. There was no room to question if it was possible; the phenomenon was real. With his regained power, Gustav's appearance grew more ominous. He didn't look entirely inhuman, but the whites of his eyes had turned pale purple. This change was true for Karl as well. While Gustav now held more magicules, they seemed to be of the same race.

<<Affirmative. Checking the race in question... They are presumed to be Archdemons. Given their incarnation, their threat level exceeds that of the Orc Disaster.>>

*H-hmmm*. To think there were two of them simultaneously. The revelation of this dangerous fact startled even me.

"Satoru-sama..." Princess Zenobia looked at me with worry.

To reassure her, I smiled. "Don't worry. I'll keep my promise."

Without sacrificing anyone, we had to defeat two Archdemons equivalent to a Demon Lord Seed. Honestly, it would be tough, but I was a man of my word.

![hard scene break]

Dealing with two at once was troublesome---I was considering countermeasures, but fortunately, the heavens hadn't abandoned me.

"Gu-fu-fu. Karl, can you handle these insects and wipe them all out on your own?"

"Of course. Gustav, are you willing to let me take care of this?"

"Given the circumstances, we must revise our strategy. We cannot risk damaging the vessel, so I shall prepare the battlefield."

"I appreciate that. Thank you for your kindness," Karl said, expressing his gratitude. Without waiting for a response, Gustav moved. Without chanting a spell, he used Spatial Transportation, appearing behind Princess Zenobia.

By the time I realized it, it was already too late. A suspicious Barrier had formed, encompassing the crowd in the square. Yet, I remained calm. Gustav's mention of a 'vessel' made sense---he was referring to Princess Zenobia. It seemed the demons intended to eliminate the elder princes but were reluctant to harm Princess Zenobia, likely because she was crucial for some purpose. This was fortunate for us.

<<Report. This Barrier is an Isolation Barrier that isolates the influences of the physical world. It can be destroyed by the Unique Skill Gluttony. Do you wish to proceed? YES/NO.>>

The analysis from Great Sage brought me a sense of composure. If the barrier could be broken at any time, there was no need to panic. Instead, it was an opportunity to swiftly dispose of one of the demons. That was my calm judgment. However, there was someone whose emotions got the better of them---the elder prince.

"You scoundrel, Gustav!" Crown Prince Sauzer shouted, his voice filled with rage. He believed his sister had been abducted. Though he seemed to have reverted to his original frail state, showing no promise in combat, his determined eyes remained unchanged as he glared at Gustav, who he now saw not just as a traitor but as the mastermind behind it all.

"You're no longer of any use. Well then, die!" Mocking Sauzer's outburst, Karl unleashed a blast of magic.

But at that moment---

"Brother!" Prince Aslan cried out and shielded Crown Prince Sauzer.

"Aslan! Why...why did you protect me?!" Sauzer lamented as he tried to lift the collapsed Prince Aslan.

"Gu-fu-fu. The sight of the weak lamenting is always a delight," Gustav's joyful voice echoed. While maintaining the Isolation Barrier, he could still observe what was happening inside. Since we could see Gustav and Princess Zenobia, it seemed the barrier only blocked physical influences.

"That's right. Those emotions are truly delicious. Please, entertain me more!" From his words, it became clear that the demons fed on human emotions like nourishment. As troublesome and vile as they were, I couldn't complain since they were underestimating us.

"Hm, I...wish to be your shield...and your sword against your enemies... It's a wish I've had since childhood... If only you weren't deceived..." Aslan murmured weakly.

"Oh, Aslan, how foolish...I love..." Crown Prince Sauzer began, but there was no time for sentiment. Gustav and Karl watched the exchange with amusement. It might have been moving, but now wasn't the time for such things. I had no intention of getting involved in the drama.

Ignoring the mood, I took action. "Alright, alright, you're in the way. Here, take this!" I presented a healing potion to Prince Aslan, who was on the brink of death from a single magic blast. This would heal his wounds and restore him to full health.

" " " "Huh?!" " " "

Gustav, Karl, and Aslan's voices harmonized perfectly in surprise.

"Y-you! What in the world is that ridiculous healing potion?!" Karl shouted, his voice grating, but I had no obligation to answer him. Ignoring his outrage, I then presented honey to Crown Prince Sauzer.

"You're in the way, so take this and back down." Though he seemed frail, this would likely improve his condition. However, since he couldn't be expected to perform well in battle, it was best for him to stay out of the way.

Now that I had finished assessing the situation, I had also devised a plan.

<Benimaru, Souei, are you ready?>

<I've been waiting!>

<Ready to go.>

<Alright! The three of us are going to take down that bastard Karl in one go! He seems to be underestimating us, so let's show him that his complacency will be his downfall.>

<Hm, of course.>

<The folly of his actions shall be repaid with his own life.>

*Hmhm*. Benimaru didn't falter, even against tough opponents, just like always. Souei was as confident as ever. A bit intimidating, but right now, they were reassuring. I was confident we could win this.

"Listen up, we'll take him down together. The rest of you, stay out of the way and take cover on the sidelines!"

With those words as my signal, the demon-slaying began.

![soft scene break]

Paulo was knocked out by Souei, but since it was done with restraint, he regained consciousness quickly. This meant he was fully aware of what had transpired in front of him and was stunned by the seriousness of the situation. His comrades were trapped within the Barrier. Even the enemies they had been fighting against had now joined forces to confront the true mastermind. The situation was dire.

*There's no way we can win against them, right?!* Paulo thought, panic rising within him. *They're Archdemons, and there are two of them!* Even ten A rank adventurers wouldn't guarantee victory. These were foes against whom losing several lives wouldn't be surprising. With two such enemies, it was only natural for Paulo, who wasn't even A rank, to feel despair. *Besides, I'm badly injured right now---*

He then remembered something in his waist pouch: the absurd healing potion given to him by Rimuru. The moment he touched it, Paulo felt an inexplicable calm wash over him. The fear was still there, but the trembling in his hands and feet disappeared. Regaining his composure, he surveyed the situation and saw the person held captive by the demon known as Gustav. It was Princess Zenobia---fragile and someone who needed to be protected.

*Come to think of it, I wanted to be a champion.* Rimuru came to mind. Although he didn't look like a champion, his actions were extraordinary. Paulo hadn't said it aloud, but he realized that even with all his effort, he couldn't match Rimuru's competence. The weapon Rimuru had casually handed him was likely on par with unique-grade weapons.

*He trusted me enough to give me something so valuable... That's right! If it's him, even in times like this---*

Rimuru was currently unjustly imprisoned in the castle. If Paulo could reach him, perhaps Rimuru could defeat these demons. *I need to rescue Princess Zenobia somehow and seek help from Rimuru*, Paulo decided. It was a reckless plan with no guarantees.

"Don't be reckless. Focus on what you can do effectively!" Rimuru's words echoed in his mind, fueling his determination even more. *I'll do it. I'll do what I can do. Even if it ends in failure, I'll face it with pride!*

With newfound resolve, Paulo quietly stoked his fighting spirit.

![soft scene break]

Gustav watched with a twisted pleasure as his colleague Karl fought. Believing themselves to be the strongest, he never expected they would lose to mere humans. However, his confidence would soon be shattered.

*That's absurd! He nullified Karl's magic?*

The ones currently facing Karl were strangers from another country. One of them simply waved his hand and dispelled the magic. It was an unbelievable sight. Gustav and Karl stood at the pinnacle of the demon race. An Archdemon incarnate had the potential to rival even a Demon Lord. Magic spells were cast instantly without incantations, yet every attack failed. Karl, who should have been overwhelmingly superior, was outmaneuvered by those who were supposed to be inferior. Gustav now realized the three were not humans, but Majins.

Being incarnated had now become a curse, having been bound by physical restraints. Karl's body, which should have healed instantly, was having its regeneration ability suppressed by the continuously burning black flames.

*This is bad, very bad! If this continues, Karl will be killed. Even if he doesn't perish, the precious incarnation will be wasted... But even if I help him, there's no guarantee of victory...*

This plan was part of a long-term strategy spanning decades. Gustav and Karl's grand scheme was to manifest and incarnate a deity worshiped by the demonic followers. The reward for this was the highest rank among the direct subordinates of their deity---to become the right-hand man of the manifested Violet Lord, Viole, and rule the world. That was their dream. Yet reality was merciless. Karl's screams echoed. The mightiest Archdemon was being toyed with by unknown Majins. If the strongest weapon of the demon race, magic, was sealed, Gustav could face the same fate.

*This can't be. Now that the plan has unraveled, any more failures are unacceptable...* Originally, the plan was for the prince brothers, heirs to the throne, to kill each other, turning this country into a land of tragedy and despair. Furthermore, by framing Demon Lord Valentin for the crime, they intended to evoke a sense of crisis among humanity. Yet---all Gustav had left in his hands was Princess Zenobia. She was intended as the vessel for their god, a girl who had to be absolutely protected. Though she was currently asleep, not a single scratch had been inflicted on her.

There were two possible courses of action. The first was to escape with Princess Zenobia. Even if they caused widespread suffering elsewhere, the incarnation of their god could still be achieved without being tied to the Kingdom of Coleus. Even this alone would fulfill Gustav's ambition, but---*No, that's unacceptable. If it were known that I had devised such a sloppy plan, I would be eliminated by the great one. Terrifying. That must be avoided at all costs...*

If he earned the god's favor, he would have all the glory in this world. However, if he incurred disfavor, Gustav's very existence would be erased from this world. Viole was a primordial being and the origin of Gustav and Karl. Hence, Viole held the power of life and death over them, and beings like Gustav and Karl existed solely for her. Therefore, Gustav had no choice but to take the remaining option.

Gustav laid the sleeping Princess Zenobia at his feet and resorted to a forbidden method. "Veil of the Dark Night, descend! Source of all negative emotions, come forth! My kin, 'Karl,' become my sustenance!" He fortified the Isolation Barrier with multiple layers to prevent interference, blocking visibility both inside and outside. With this in place, he gathered power by absorbing the negative emotions across the Kingdom of Coleus. It was an inefficient enhancement method with only a brief effect for the effort it required, but that momentary boost was enough. The true objective lay in merging with his kin---in other words, a demon fusion.

As spiritual lifeforms, demons could steal a portion of their enemy's power by killing them. Furthermore, demons of the same lineage could fuse for super-enhancement. The fused power of both entities would result in the one with the stronger will taking control. As this would lead to the disappearance of the other entity, it was considered taboo. However, it was a quintessentially demonic method of survival and power enhancement.

The power obtained through this method would mostly dissipate in a few days, leaving only a fraction behind, making it largely meaningless. However, it could be a useful tactic when facing difficult opponents.

Gustav now judged Rimuru and his companions as a significant threat. Opting to fight instead of fleeing, he sacrificed Karl to gain power. "Gu-fu-fu. My physical body can't fully handle this power. It's only a short-term power-up, but it's more than enough to slaughter those Majins. With this strength, even Demon Lord Valentin would be like a mere infant! Now, let's begin!" Muttering to no one in particular, Gustav made his declaration.

He intended to enter the Isolation Barrier and massacre those inside, who were still in disarray. Though using nuclear magic would be the simplest way to dispatch them, it wouldn't leave behind any corpses, which would be problematic for the plan. The narrative had to remain that the two princes killed each other. Having seen one of the Majins cancel out magic, Gustav wanted to ensure no mistakes.

He was about to step forward when he noticed something strange. Princess Zenobia had disappeared. No, a suspicious man was trying to abduct her. "Who are you, daring to get in my way?!" Gustav's anger flared at being outwitted by a mere human. Normally, such a thing would be impossible, but he was caught off guard during the taboo moment of demonic fusion.

The one who accomplished this feat was Paulo, who had recovered with the healing potion. He overcame his fear and moved forward with the plan. Holding Princess Zenobia in his arms, Paulo ran desperately. She was petite and not a burden for Paulo. With his near-A rank speed, he could reach the royal castle in less than a minute. But Gustav would not allow it.

"You fool. Do you think you can escape from me? Dark Magic: Forbidden---"

Princess Zenobia was important, but Paulo was insignificant. Thus, without even chanting a spell, Gustav unleashed his Youki to destroy Paulo's heart. However, on the darkened street, shrouded by the veil of the dark night, stood a figure cloaked in pitch-black. With just a wave of her finger, this figure dispersed Gustav's magic wave. She then spoke to the astonished Paulo.

"Beyond this point lies a Barrier. Don't run pointlessly; stay there quietly and watch. Out of respect for your intent to save that girl, I will protect you." Paulo nodded vigorously and sank to the street as instructed.

Gustav pondered. This entire area had been sealed under the king's name to prevent any interference. As the girl had said, a magical barrier was activated to ensure no one could escape. It was impossible for any townspeople to have infiltrated. Moreover, it was impossible for an ordinary human to interfere with Gustav's magic. No longer concerned with Paulo, Gustav directed his attention to the intruder.

"Who are you?"

This time, Gustav asked calmly. While his rational mind commanded him to kill the intruder without hesitation, his body did not obey. It was as if Gustav was afraid of this figure...

"I have no intention of revealing myself to someone as insignificant as you!"

"What?!"

"My, my, I actually had no intention of getting involved. Given the current state of that person, dealing with your transformed self might be too much for him. However, since I'm indulging in this, you should consider it an honor." The figure removed their robe and put it away somewhere.

Revealed was a beautiful silver-haired girl. What stood out most were her eyes---one blue and one red. Her heterochromatic eyes gleamed mystically as she glared at Gustav.

"A Majin? A brat like you being so cheeky---"

At this moment, Gustav made a fatal mistake. Judging his opponent by appearance alone was a laughable blunder, deserving ridicule from anyone who heard it. The consequences were severe. Even though Gustav struck with a power that exceeded his limits, his punch was effortlessly caught by the girl's slender arm.

"---What?"

It was charged with immense magical power, capable of obliterating even a castle. Yet, the girl maintained a calm and composed expression. Finally, Gustav realized that this girl was no ordinary person. However, it was already too late.

"Weak."

"T-that's absurd! That was my full strength!"

"I don't care."

Gustav's arm was promptly broken, followed by a kick to his abdomen that felt like it could shatter his spine. The force was so intense that he coughed up blood.

"What is this? So you've been mimicking humans and eating food? It's messy and repulsive, so I'll spare you the torment."

The girl smirked, revealing small, pure white fangs at the corners of her mouth.

"S-so you're a vampire? And stronger than me?!"

Gustav was shocked and bewildered. He had the confidence to defeat even the famed Demon Lord Valentin, known as the strongest among vampires. Yet this girl far surpassed his expectations. It was hard to believe, but it was the reality.

"Y-you...W-who are you...?"

"You have no need to know."

With a cold reply ringing in his ears, Gustav realized his defeat. He understood that he would be destroyed if things continued like this. *This is bad! If I do nothing, I'll perish without achieving anything---! If that happens, I, I---*

He would incur the wrath of his master. That prospect was more terrifying than death itself. So Gustav took a desperate gamble---but it would lead to an unfortunate outcome for him.

As he leaped backward, Gustav saw Paulo holding the sleeping Princess Zenobia.

"You're a nuisance!"

"Huh?"

It happened in an instant. In an effort to shield Princess Zenobia, Paulo swiftly twisted his body and stepped forward. Even without understanding Gustav's intentions, Paulo knew he was up to no good. Thinking quickly, he decided to use his own body as a shield to protect Princess Zenobia.

*Well, it might be lame and maybe pointless, but this is the best I can do.*

That was Paulo, doing his utmost in his own way. However, that effort turned out to be his own stroke of luck.

"Heyyy, out of the way!" Gustav shouted and struck Paulo. Because Paulo stepped forward, Gustav was unable to unleash his powerful attack. In his desperation not to involve Princess Zenobia, the attack didn't become a fatal blow. Most importantly, thanks to Paulo fainting pleasantly from that single strike, he avoided experiencing the terror that was to come.

Without further concern for Paulo, Gustav focused on his ritual. Before him, Gustav deployed multiple layers of Defense Barriers and initiated a simplified ritual.

"O great primordial deity! Reside within this vessel and lend me your power!"

Foolishly, Gustav attempted to manifest a god using Princess Zenobia as a vessel, despite not being fully prepared.

"What a fool," the girl muttered in disbelief. Having vowed to protect Paulo, she glanced briefly to ensure he was still alive. Satisfied that he was fine, she calmly observed the ritual unfolding before her. The girl could foresee what was to come next.

Princess Zenobia's body jumped high into the air, floating. She was then enveloped in a dense, purple Youki that seemed to surge from the atmosphere, forming a cocoon around her.

"Oh, ohhhhh! It worked! I've won this gamble! You're finished. Whoever you are, you'll regret going against us!"

Given the incomplete and simplified state of the ritual, the success rate of summoning the god was extremely low. Considering this, Gustav's joy was immense. As long as the god descended, victory was assured regardless of the opponent. That was what he believed.

However...

The god was incredibly cruel.

"Hello, Luminas. I didn't want to waste the opportunity to at least come and say hello."

The god spoke not to Gustav, but directly to the girl he was antagonizing.

*Eh? Wait, wait a moment. Is the god, Viole-sama, acquainted with this person? No, wait... Luminas, did she say Luminas?! Then this must be the former Demon Lord---Queen of Nightmares, Luminas Valentine, who was said to have perished!*

It was an astonishing and shocking revelation. However, even if Gustav now knew the girl's true identity, there was nothing he could do. He could only tremble and pray that the gods' attention did not turn toward him.

"Tch, it's really you after all. Viole, I've told you before, stop causing trouble for me."

"Ahahaha! No way. I love doing things people hate. Especially with someone as shrewd as you---outsmarting you is quite the challenge. Since we're playing together anyway, I want to have fun too. Looking forward to it!"

"How shameless..."

At that moment, Luminas and Viole clashed. They engaged in an intense battle, wielding nothing but their bare hands.

*I-I can't believe it. I'm witnessing a battle of the gods right now! Alright, if Viole-sama can just take care of Luminas---*

Gustav hoped, but his wish was in vain. Luminas and Viole were not serious; they were merely exchanging pleasantries.

"Well, your skills haven't dulled, it seems. Impressive, impressive."

"You're so loud! What about you? How do you plan to settle this?"

"Hmm, let's see..."

Listening to their conversation, Gustav felt a foreboding sense that things were taking a dangerous turn.

"O-O god, I, I---"

"Yeah. For one of my subordinates, it's disappointing that you can't handle even such a simple task. I allowed you to act freely because you happened to be incarnated, but it seems that as an 'early modern species,' this is the extent of your wit. How unfortunate!"

"Wait! Next time, next time for sure I will definitely succeed. Even this time, I have accomplished incarnating you---"

"Hahh? I only manifested my power forcibly through this child's body."

"Heh?!"

"You have no accomplishments to speak of. Don't make me laugh."

A very cold gaze pierced through Gustav.

"I'm disappointed. If you're going to leave evidence, then I'll have to deal with you myself." Viole said. "It's such a hassle," she added, looking exasperated.

Upon hearing that, for some reason, Gustav misunderstood. Believing the words were directed at Luminas rather than himself, he approached Viole with a jubilant expression.

"Oh, oooh! If it's you, surely you'll be able to take Lumina's head ---"

Viole's patience with Gustav's attitude finally reached its limit.

"Idiooot."

"W-wait, what---?!"

Not a second later, she pronounced his death sentence with a sing-song voice.

"Disappear, trash."

"N-no, Abuaah!"

And so, the demon that had incarnated and assimilated with Court Physician Gustav was sent plummeting into hell by Viole's hand.

"Well then, I'm off. Bye-bye!"

"Hmph! Truly capricious and exceedingly troublesome."

Left behind, Luminas muttered discontentedly. She had come to observe someone of interest but ended up completely entangled in this mess. It was strictly forbidden to reveal her presence to that person, which had put her in quite a predicament.

With the disappearance of the caster, the Isolation Barrier also vanished. Luminas, while grateful that Gustav made multiple layers of barriers, contemplated her next move. Then, she recalled the unconscious person.

It was none other than Paulo. She generously healed his wounds with restoration magic and woke him up. Then---

"You, come closer."

"Y-yes!"

Paulo stepped forward as commanded. Understanding Luminas as an absolute powerhouse, he had no choice but to comply.

Luminas smiled sweetly, her eyes glimmering with a mystical light.

"Listen closely. You knocked this guy out with that stick, didn't you?"

"Yes! I knocked him out!"

"Umu, good."

It was a moment where the vampires' specialty, Charm, demonstrated its true effectiveness.

Thus, having framed Paulo as the culprit, Luminas washed her hands of the matter and fled the scene, leaving everything else behind.

![soft scene break]

We were trapped within the Isolation Barrier, but it made the battle easier for us. I dispelled the magic, Souei immobilized Karl, and then Benimaru struck him down. It was a completely one-sided and effortless victory. However, just as we were about to deliver the finishing blow, something unexpected happened.

Karl suddenly collapsed. He wasn't dead but unconscious. Moreover, he had aged drastically and lost all his strength.

"It seems like he's reverted back to being just a human," I said, and everyone nodded.

<<Report. The flow of power has been confirmed. The Archdemon assimilated with the individual: Karl appeared to have been absorbed by the individual: Gustav.>>

Were they fighting among themselves?

Anyway, if Karl was incapacitated, it was Gustav's turn next. With that determination, I stepped outside the Isolation Barrier to find Gustav lying on the ground and Paulo standing with his staff at the ready.

"Eh, you defeated him?"

"Yes! I did it!" Paulo cheerfully replied.

<<Answer. The demon fusion is considered taboo and highly difficult. In unforeseen circumstances, the likelihood of failure is high.>>

So, Paulo's well-timed blow caused the ritual to fail? If that was true, Paulo had scored a surprise victory. It was hard to believe, but Gustav's menacing presence had vanished. Moreover, searching the vicinity revealed no signs of any Archdemon lurking around.

<<Report. Demons cannot sustain their existence without a host. It's not possible for them to possess just anyone, so it's reasonable to assume the individual was defeated.>>

While there was a possibility he escaped, the threat had ceased. Then, there was no point in further pursuit. Though I was not fully satisfied, this was where it ended. What was more important was the safety of Princess Zenobia.

I rushed to her side as she lay on the ground to check her condition. Breathing and pulse were normal. She was weakened but otherwise in good health.

"Zenobia! Is she alright?"

"Brother, please calm down. Let's trust Satoru-dono."

Crown Prince Sauzer, who had hurried over, asked me with concern, and Prince Aslan intervened to reassure him. For some reason, their trust in me seemed to have grown.

"I don't see any physical issues. She should wake up shortly."

I debated using formal language, but it felt too late for that. Currently, I was posing as the Great Phantom Thief. While knowing it might be inappropriate, I responded in my usual manner.

"I appreciate it."

"Now, Great Phantom Thief, I have an important question for you. May I ask?"

The princes expressed their gratitude to me. Afterward, Crown Prince Sauzer looked at me with a formal demeanor. I had a strong, unpleasant feeling about this. If they were to ask something like, "As the Great Phantom Thief, have you stolen something?" it would quickly become a serious problem.

Maybe I was overthinking, but before things became troublesome---

"Sorry, but we're quite busy ourselves. We'll take our leave now."

I replied and then called Benimaru and Souei. Activating Spatial Transportation, we swiftly retreated from the scene.

![hard scene break]

I woke up in the cell. Stretching my arms, I casually remarked, "Hmm, I slept well." The guard, looking somewhat exasperated, responded, "Hey, you're quite bold. To sleep in a situation like this---what kind of heart do you have?"

I chuckled, "Haha, my heart is quite special." Of course, as a slime, I didn't actually have a heart.

The conversation took on an unexpectedly relaxed tone. With the mastermind caught, the case resolved, and my innocence proven, I was about to be released. So, I decided to enjoy the brief experience of being in prison.

Sure enough, after a short while, a commotion erupted, and a messenger soldier rushed in. "U-urgent order from Crown Prince Sauzer: release that person from the cell immediately!"

"W-what?!"

Just as expected, I was freed. Since my attire hadn't changed, there was no need to tidy up my appearance. Without any guidance, I was greeted directly by the princes.

Prince Aslan spoke immediately, "I apologize, but my sister has become weakened once again. If possible, could you share some of your secret medicine? I would appreciate it."

Although I had anticipated her waking up soon, Aslan seemed genuinely concerned for his sister. Understanding his worry, I gladly handed over the honey.

The guard who had been watching us spoke up in disbelief, "Where on earth did you..."

Seeing the princes treating me with such formality after our casual chat seemed to baffle him. I felt a bit of sympathy for his confusion.

Prince Aslan passed the honey to Crown Prince Sauzer. Sauzer examined it and said, "Hmm, just as I suspected. It's the same as what I received."

"So it was indeed the case," Aslan agreed, nodding---*Ah!*

*Wait, could it be? Are they suspecting that 'Rimuru' and the Great Phantom Thief 'Satoru' are the same person?! I done did it, what a huge blunder,* I thought but it was too late to fix it now.

![hard scene break]

We moved to a luxurious reception room, where I sat facing three people. Behind them stood Barak-san and, for some reason, Paulo. They seemed to be acting as guards, but Paulo's presence was puzzling.

Princess Zenobia had already awakened, and she didn't need the honey after all. It appeared that I had been tested, but since nothing had been exposed, I decided to put my worries aside. Although the honey was evidence, they hadn't uncovered my skills, so I could still avoid responsibility.

To my surprise, they didn't pursue the matter any further.

"Thanks to you, Rimuru-sama, I am now free. I intend to study hard and broaden my horizons to serve my brothers well," said Princess Zenobia.

"Rimuru-dono, I owe you everything. I am deeply grateful," added Prince Aslan.

"Without your cooperation, we wouldn't have been able to converse like this. The thought of continuing a blood-soaked struggle among ourselves is chilling. We feel deeply indebted to you. Please remember this, and don't hesitate to rely on us if anything arises," said Crown Prince Sauzer.

Each of the three expressed their gratitude in their own way, and it seemed they had figured out more than I initially thought. But sometimes, it was better to leave things unsaid.

"Likewise. I'm glad I could be of help, even in a small way. If you ever need more medicine, please visit the merchant Myourmiles. I'm sure he'll assist you willingly," I replied, subtly promoting our potions. I was determined to make the most of opportunities to promote my nation's potions.

Prince Aslan chuckled. "Fufu, a merchant associated with the monster nation that has recently risen in power, I see."

"Speaking of which, the chancellor of that country is named Rimuru Tempest, it seems. What a coincidence," added Crown Prince Sauzer with a nod.

Their ability to gather information was impressive, or rather, it was so obvious that there was no point in trying to cover it up anymore. I could only smile wryly at the situation.

"When did you realize it?" I asked.

Crown Prince Sauzer explained, "I thought it might be rude, but once you healed Zenobia, we sent someone to investigate. The report just arrived a moment ago." He showed no sign of thinking it was rude at all.

As the future king of a military nation responsible for guarding the remote reaches, it was only natural that he would have such tricks. I noted that there were things I could learn from him and hoped we could get along well in the future.

Oh right, let's not forget about the king, who is suspected to be the mastermind. "So, I remembered something. Was it indeed the king of this country who was manipulating you brothers to fight?"

"Well, about that, actually---" Princess Zenobia began to explain the fate of the king.

.........

......

Deep within the Kingdom of Coleus, in a private chamber accessible only to nobility, King Tedron sat with a fierce scowl on his face. "That incompetent fool! He has betrayed my expectations..."

Approaching old age and weakened in strength, Tedron's eyes burned with a fierce desire. He was the mastermind behind the scenes, orchestrating everything with a desperate resolve. With his life nearing its end, Tedron had nothing to lose and had taken a colossal gamble. He loathed the idea of relinquishing power and plotted to transfer his consciousness into a youthful prince.

The situation was further complicated by Tedron's unfortunate depth of knowledge. Skilled in ancient magic, he, in collaboration with several mages, had successfully performed the forbidden summoning of an Archdemon, which was then transferred into Court Physician Gustav. With the strongest demon as his right-hand man, Tedron's plan had initially progressed smoothly. The two princes were at odds, and a clash seemed inevitable. Tedron anticipated that he would soon possess the victor.

However, meticulously laid plans unraveled and vanished due to an unwelcome guest.

"Damn it! If it comes to this, then I'll personally take on a demon within my own body!" Tedron growled. With his time running out, he could afford no errors, leading him to contemplate reckless actions.

Yet, such actions were not permitted.

"Fool. It is because you indulged in such foolish actions that you allowed Viole's schemes to flourish. This country was also a safeguard against the Mad King, and had you quietly protected this land, I would have granted you a reward in your dying moments," a voice echoed.

"Wha---who are you? Who dares---"

"You, of all people, still wonder who I am?"

"I-it can't be?"

It was only then that Tedron finally saw the source of the voice. Reclining elegantly on the couch, more poised than the room's master, was the beautiful demon lord.

"You are the Guardian of the West---"

"I offer no mercy. Reflect on your transgressions in Hell for dabbling in forbidden matters."

Those were the last words Tedron heard before his life was forcibly drained. He endured a tormented demise until his life finally ceased.

The following morning, the death of King Tedron, who had long ruled the country, was quietly confirmed.

"And so, by the time soldiers moved to apprehend him, the king had already passed away," Princess Zenobia concluded.

Crown Prince Sauzer then explained, "Well, off the record, it might have turned out for the best. By the charges, the death penalty was the only outcome, but I didn't want to bear the stain of patricide."

Sauzer's demeanor had already taken on the aura of a king, and it seemed he would soon be crowned. With this matter settled, it felt as though all problems had truly been resolved.

Deeply relieved, I lost track of time as we chatted over dinner. For some reason, Princess Zenobia mentioned having lost her unique skill, while Paulo announced his acceptance into the Kingdom of Coleus and his appointment as the Knight Commander. Prince Aslan would support King Sauzer as the Minister of Military Affairs.

The next day, I bid everyone farewell and began my journey home. Paulo did not accompany me. Originally, he was to undergo a promotion review, but since he decided to retire from adventuring and take up employment, there was no longer any need for him to return to the capital of Ingracia.

Unlike the journey there, the return was swift. As soon as everyone was out of sight, I activated Elemental Magic: Warp Portal.

"I see you've returned quite quickly. It seems everything went well," Yuuki remarked.

"Of course. Not only did I gather information, but I also managed to resolve the issue," I replied.

"It's so impressive, it's almost unbelievable."

Yuuki chuckled wryly, and I proceeded to explain the whole story.

"Thank you so much for everything this time. Thanks to you, Rimuru-san, we were able to prevent the Coleus branch's separation. We've also saved face for the headquarters, and I believe our archaeological exploration in that region will proceed smoothly from now on."

"I see, that's good to hear."

Seeing Yuuki so pleased, I felt that my efforts had been worthwhile. With that, the mission was officially concluded.

The next day, I showed up at the academy. I reunited with the kids sooner than I had expected, but---

"Hey, Sensei, did you miss us while you were away?"

"Tiss-sensei's lessons were so clear and thorough, even more than yours, Rimuru-sensei!"

"Yeah, yeah! But I found your lessons more fun, Sensei."

"Ahaha. They say this, but everyone was feeling lonely without you, Sensei---"

"Geez, Gale, you're so noisy!"

"Ufufu, I'm glad Rimuru-sensei has returned. Welcome back!"

" " "Welcome back!" " "

At Chloe's signal, everyone welcomed me back with smiles. It made me happy because I had grown fond of this life.

And so, my short but intense vacation came to an end. Even though I didn't really rest, seeing the kids' smiles made it all worthwhile.

![soft scene break]

In the future, the Kingdom of Coleus was abuzz with surprising news: the birth of a new demon lord, known as "Newbie" Rimuru Tempest.

Reactions to this news varied widely.

"Well! He's grown up so beautifully, but now I guess I won't be able to marry him. What a shame."

"Hmph, with that kind of strength, being called a Demon Lord makes sense."

"Regardless, it's a joyous occasion. We must establish diplomatic relations with their nation."

Leading the way with smiles was King Sauzer himself.

However, one individual was noticeably concerned.

"This is bad... I spoke so cheekily to a Demon Lord and still haven't repaid the money I borrowed. And I even got this six-foot staff from him... What should I do?"

Knight Commander Paulo of the feared and formidable Kingdom of Coleus spent the following days with a pale, anxious face, fretting over his situation.

However, there was no need for concern. Paulo was a person of great fortune, having survived without ever encountering Viole, thanks to being unconscious during the ordeal.

As expected, he would later become known as "He who mooched off a Demon Lord."
