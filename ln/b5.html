<h1 class="ch-name">Coleus’s Dream Part 1</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_18">Inside a dim, dark room, a girl lay on a couch. Despite her sloppy appearance, she exuded an inexplicable elegance. The source of this allure was her beauty.</p>
<p id="line_19">Her silver hair, flowing like moonlight in the night, glistened in the darkness. Her eyes, one blue and the other red, held a captivating, heterochromatic gleam. She looked to be around fifteen or sixteen years old, embodying a beauty that was both imperfect and perfected—a fleeting moment between girlhood and maturity.</p>
<p id="line_20">Lost in thought, the girl unintentionally parted her lips, revealing small, gleaming white fangs. Her inhuman beauty was a clear sign that she wasn’t quite human.</p>
<p id="line_21">“—It truly bothers me. I cannot leave it like this. I must see him with my own eyes, to know for sure…”</p>
<p id="line_22">As she absently fiddled with her neatly manicured nails, the girl made up her mind. Then, she turned her sharp gaze toward the darkness at the center of the room. There lay a coffin of ice. Within the transparent ice, a beautiful girl with flowing black hair lay naked and asleep.</p>
<p id="line_23">The silver-haired girl stood and approached the ice coffin. When she touched the coffin with a finger, a bruise resembling a burn appeared. Ignoring it, the girl sighed.</p>
<p id="line_24">With a gaze filled with myriad emotions, she looked at the girl encased in ice and spoke. “Rest assured. I will see that your wish is granted.”</p>
<p id="line_25">It was a declaration of resolve.</p>
<p id="line_26">Then, the girl left the room.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_27">After finishing the children’s outdoor training, I returned from the town of Guratol to the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_28">It was the first class after the weekend, and as we gathered for the morning assembly, Chloe asked a question.</p>
<p id="line_29">“Sensei, how much longer will you be staying here?”</p>
<p id="line_30">That was a tricky question. Now that the children’s issues were resolved, I didn’t have a pressing reason to stay in this town. But still…</p>
<p id="line_31">“Hmm, let’s see… I did tell everyone I’d be leaving soon, but I still have some handover tasks for Tiss-sensei. And with the academy about to go on summer break…”</p>
<p id="line_32">Though it was called a break, it was less than two weeks long. Since there were no air conditioners in this world, the academy shut down during the hottest days of summer, meaning no classes were held.</p>
<p id="line_33">The Free Guild Headquarters had automatic doors and air conditioning, thanks to cutting-edge magical science technology. But this academy didn’t have the budget for such luxuries, so each classroom relied on the students’ own efforts to stay cool. In other words, they’d just be using makeshift fans.</p>
<p id="line_34">That was the norm, but our class was different. Ryota had asked the wind spirits to provide us with a cool breeze. As a result, it was surprisingly comfortable in the summer, but there was still no reason to refuse a break. Taking a holiday in the royal capital before heading back wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p id="line_35"><em>Now that I think about it, I’ve been working non-stop.</em></p>
<p id="line_36">There was no need to rush back anyway, and I was sure <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others would understand if I explained.</p>
<p id="line_37">“Aren’t you thinking of slacking off anyway?” Alice cut in with a sharp remark. How did this child manage to read my mind so easily?</p>
<p id="line_38">Even though I doubted it would work, I put on a poker face and bluffed, “No, that’s not it. I was just thinking of leaving you all in Tiss-sensei’s capable hands before I go back. I thought it’d be good for her to teach you a few classes before the handover.”</p>
<p id="line_39">And with that, I smoothly delivered my excuse. But it backfired.</p>
<p id="line_40">“Hmm, that sounds fine.”</p>
<p id="line_41">“True. Tiss-sensei is kind, and unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, she’s serious.”</p>
<p id="line_42">“Hold on, hold on.”</p>
<p id="line_43">“Ahaha, I heard from the students in Class D that her lessons are really easy to understand.”</p>
<p id="line_44">“Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei doesn’t stand a chance, huh?”</p>
<p id="line_45">“Hey, hey?”</p>
<p id="line_46">“It’s not about winning or losing, but I’d like to attend Tiss-sensei’s classes too.”</p>
<p id="line_47">Even Chloe?! Even though I brought it up myself, I somehow felt like I was losing ground.</p>
<p id="line_48">“I-isn’t fine? Even if I’m gone and you end up crying? I won’t even know!”</p>
<p id="line_49">I tried to sound confident.</p>
<p id="line_50">“It’s fine, it’s fine. We’ll prove we can manage just fine without you, Sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_51">“Exactly. You’re leaving soon anyway, right? So trust us more, okay?!”</p>
<p id="line_52">The other children nodded in agreement with Kenya and Alice. It seemed like the conversation had completely derailed. At this point, there was no turning back.</p>
<p id="line_53">“Got it. Well then, I’ll do as I please during summer break. And if it puts my mind at ease, it’ll be a farewell from me to all of you, okay?”</p>
<p id="line_54">“ “ “Okaaaaay!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_55"><em>Urk</em>, that was a quick response. Was children’s growth really this rapid? Instead of feeling happy, I found myself a little lonely.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_56">That night. I was having a drink with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in his office. I wanted to discuss with him future arrangements, including leaving the children in Tiss-sensei’s care during the summer break. I explained the situation in detail. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> listened with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p id="line_57">“So, are you really that upset about it?”</p>
<p id="line_58">“No, not at all. I’m not upset. I don’t feel lonely or anything like that; I’m just relieved.”</p>
<p id="line_59">“Ohh, is that so?”</p>
<p id="line_60"><em>Yeah, it is so.</em></p>
<p id="line_61">I transformed into my slime form and averted my gaze from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He gave me a sharp look, as if he might dig deeper, but then he sighed and changed the subject.</p>
<p id="line_62">“Understood. You’ve helped me a lot, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, so let’s go with that. I’ll take care of the arrangements with Tiss-sensei. As the board chairman, I’ll check her availability to look after the children during the summer break.”</p>
<p id="line_63">Though he said he’d check her availability, as chairman, it wasn’t like she could refuse. In any case, the school still had work to do during the break. Since teachers were paid daily, a ten-day break would be tough for many of them.</p>
<p id="line_64">“I’m counting on you. Well, I’m also a bit worried, so I’ll probably stick around a little longer before heading back. You know, the kids might feel lonely and cry.”</p>
<p id="line_65">“I don’t think that’s going to happen.”</p>
<p id="line_66">“…It will, though?”</p>
<p id="line_67">“It won’t. Anyway, is that all you needed?”</p>
<p id="line_68">I was casually brushed off. More like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, still drinking, flipped through some documents with one hand. It seemed he was reading a report, and the content appeared more serious than I had thought. At first, I thought he was pretending to work to brush me off, but as his expression gradually grew stern, I realized it wasn’t just an act.</p>
<p id="line_69">“Did something happen?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_70">“Yeah, well…things have gotten a bit troublesome.”</p>
<p id="line_71">“Is it related to me? If not, I feel like I’m intruding, so maybe we should wrap things up here?”</p>
<p id="line_72">Sensing a negative vibe, I suggested this, but it turned out to be an unnecessary remark. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was about to respond, suddenly closed his mouth. Then, he looked at me and smiled gently. That was when I realized I’d messed up.</p>
<p id="line_73">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, you seem to have a lot of free time.”</p>
<p id="line_74">“No, I’m busy.”</p>
<p id="line_75">“You’re free during the summer break, right?”</p>
<p id="line_76">“No, no, I have to take care of the kids—”</p>
<p id="line_77">“I’ll ask Tiss-sensei to handle that, so could I ask for your advice?”</p>
<p id="line_78"><em>Grr</em>… I wanted to refuse, but I was the one who asked for advice first.</p>
<p id="line_79">I decided to listen, since I didn’t really have a choice.</p>
<p id="line_80">“Just advice, right? So, what’s going on?”</p>
<p id="line_81">“Actually, there’s a troublesome issue brewing in the Kingdom of Coleus, which borders the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It started as a domestic matter, so we were just observing quietly, but it seems we can’t stay passive any longer—”</p>
<p id="line_82">The Kingdom of Coleus was a nation located west of the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and south of the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It bordered both great powers, with a vast, barren desert to its west. It was a member of the Council of the West but wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about diplomacy. This might be why trade was minimal, and not much information flowed from there. In terms of national scale, it ranked in the lower tier of the upper-ranked countries. It was not a great power per se, but it held a respectable position.</p>
<p id="line_83">A notable feature was their complete acceptance of the Freemen. They welcomed wandering Freemen as citizens without discrimination, resulting in a population exceeding 20 million. Many adventurers gathered there to hunt <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from the desert, giving the Free Guild a high status. However, a major incident had occurred, shaking the very foundation of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="line_84">“In short, it’s the struggle for the throne,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to speak. “The conflict is between His Highness Sauzer Coleus, the eldest brother and appointed crown prince, and His Highness Aslan Coleus, the younger prince born to the king’s concubine. There are other siblings, but they’re distancing themselves to avoid getting involved. Crown Prince Sauzer, born to the queen, has strong support from the nobles. In contrast, Prince Aslan’s mother is a low-status woman from the Hot Sand People. Normally, this wouldn’t even be a contest, but here’s where the problem lies…”</p>
<p id="line_85"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hesitated to continue. It seemed that this problem was also affecting the current troublesome situation.</p>
<p id="line_86">“What kind of problem?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_87"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked at me hesitantly.</p>
<p id="line_88">“When I think about it calmly, this is a major issue. Even though it’s you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, I can’t talk about it without some guarantee that you’ll help.”</p>
<p id="line_89">I nodded in agreement. I was only intending to offer some advice, but getting involved in a succession dispute of some kingdom wasn’t really my business. Even a child would know it’s foolish to stick your neck into such risky matters.</p>
<p id="line_90">“Yeah, you’re right. I was definitely being a bit too curious myself.”</p>
<p id="line_91">I was about to say, “Let’s just forget about it,” but as soon as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> heard that, he smirked.</p>
<p id="line_92"><em>Hm?</em> I thought to myself, but I realized it too late.</p>
<p id="line_93">“Is that so? It’s reassuring to hear you say that!”</p>
<p id="line_94">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_95">“Actually, His Highness Aslan is an A rank adventurer!”</p>
<p id="line_96">“Ah!”</p>
<p id="line_97">“Not just in his own country, but also in the surrounding nations, he’s a renowned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, often called the Prince of the Hot Sands. As such, he’s someone the Free Guild can’t afford to ignore.”</p>
<p id="line_98">“What are you casually saying? I have no intention of listening—”</p>
<p id="line_99">“Isn’t it obvious? Since you kindly agreed to help, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, I’ll provide you with all the information!”</p>
<p id="line_100"><em>This guy, he set me up! He’s been putting on a blatant act this whole time just to drag me into this…But now that I’ve heard all this, it seems difficult to keep insisting I’m not involved.</em></p>
<p id="line_101">While thinking that, I asked to be sure: “By the way, what happens if I refuse to cooperate?”</p>
<p id="line_102">“It is a no-brainer. Unfortunately, to prevent information leaks, you’ll have to stay here until this issue is resolved. Of course, I’ll provide paper, so feel free to print out as many manga as you like to pass the time.”</p>
<p id="line_103">What a sly guy. He was maneuvering things so that even if I refused to cooperate, he’d still benefit, though my cooperation would obviously be preferable. Indeed, consolidating the Free Guild in just a few years, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had proven himself to be a shrewd man with no shortage of cunning.</p>
<p id="line_104"><em>Now, what should I do? I didn’t like either option, but it seemed better to cooperate and solve the case than to be confined here. At least cooperating would likely lead to a resolution.</em></p>
<p id="line_105">With that thought in mind, I reluctantly spoke up. “I understand. I’ll cooperate.”</p>
<p id="line_106">“I knew you’d say that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>
<p id="line_107">With a dubious smile, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded at me. Feeling defeated, I decided to listen to the details anyway.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_108">As he poured a fresh drink into his cup, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> continued his explanation. “As I mentioned, Prince Aslan is an A rank adventurer. His charisma is real—he’s already gained the loyalty of the Guildmaster in the Kingdom of Coleus. And now, the Free Guild there has rebelled. They’ve declared independence from the Free Guild headquarters and aligned themselves with Prince Aslan.”</p>
<p id="line_109">“Is such a move even possible?”</p>
<p id="line_110">“While I’d like to say they’re free to declare whatever they want, allowing this would undermine the very foundation of the Free Guild. It goes against the spirit of mutual aid and would face significant backlash from members and adventurers alike. Unfortunately, the ringleader’s popularity is extraordinarily high this time, which complicates matters…”</p>
<p id="line_111">“Ah, I see. So it’s like the Free Guild members and adventurers have voluntarily decided to cooperate with him, huh?”</p>
<p id="line_112">“Exactly.”</p>
<p id="line_113"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> grimaced as he drank from his cup, making me want to join him. This was indeed a domestic issue for the Kingdom of Coleus, but it had turned into a serious situation.</p>
<p id="line_114">“What’s been the response from the Free Guild branches in the surrounding countries?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_115">“They’re waiting and watching. It’s fortunate that the branches haven’t aligned with them, but some people are scheming to make a name for themselves and secure prominent positions in the Kingdom of Coleus. We can’t leave this situation unattended.”</p>
<p id="line_116">“Yeah, that makes sense.”</p>
<p id="line_117">“Yes. Allowing this would undermine the headquarters’ credibility and could lead to major trust issues.”</p>
<p id="line_118">“If that happens, things will spiral out of control.”</p>
<p id="line_119">“It would be utter chaos. The organization is still young, and if it starts to crumble, it’ll fall apart very quickly,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed, his expression serious.</p>
<p id="line_120">This was truly troublesome. As the leader of the organization, he couldn’t possibly cater to every whim of each branch.</p>
<p id="line_121">“Why not intervene directly from headquarters?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_122">“That’s not possible,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> replied. “The Kingdom of Coleus is a member state of the Council, which gives them the authority to issue orders to the Free Guild through the Council. If they say not to intervene, we have no veto power.”</p>
<p id="line_123">“Hey, hey… In that case, could you order the surrounding Free Guild branches to halt logistics?” I suggested, thinking that even if we couldn’t stop merchants unaffiliated with the Free Guild, those who belonged to it might comply. But I was being naive.</p>
<p id="line_124">“It’s impossible. Didn’t I mention earlier that the Kingdom of Coleus has minimal trade?”</p>
<p id="line_125"><em>Oh, that’s right.</em></p>
<p id="line_126">“Besides,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> continued, “even if we were to restrict merchant activities, we’d need to provide them with assurances. We don’t have the budget for that.”</p>
<p id="line_127">Understanding this, I felt a wave of frustration. It seemed my amateurish ideas had already been considered and dismissed long ago. So why did he ask for my help in the first place?</p>
<p id="line_128">“It sounds like there aren’t many viable options,” I said, “but what do you plan to do? Or rather, what do you expect from me?”</p>
<p id="line_129"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shrugged. “I was hoping you might come up with a solution that hadn’t occurred to me.”</p>
<p id="line_130">“Sorry, I’m not much help.”</p>
<p id="line_131">“No, no. Honestly, I’m aware it’s a bit of a stretch, so it’s not on you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>
<p id="line_132">Seeing my wry smile, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked genuinely apologetic and bowed his head. He seemed truly troubled, with no ill intent.</p>
<p id="line_133">“As a solution, we’ve concluded that infiltration and covert operations within the Kingdom of Coleus are our best options. So, what I’d like to ask of you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, is…”</p>
<p id="line_134">“If you’re suggesting I assassinate Prince Aslan, I’m afraid I’ll have to decline,” I interrupted, understanding where this might be heading. Meddling in another country’s affairs was risky, and as the chancellor of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Country, it could easily escalate into an international incident.</p>
<p id="line_135">Of course, if my identity remained hidden, it would be manageable. But an assassination was a different matter entirely—ethically unacceptable and against my conscience. Therefore, I must decline such a job.</p>
<p id="line_136">Understanding my sentiments, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smiled wryly. “Ahaha, I wouldn’t burden you with dirty work like that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. Of course, running an organization isn’t all clean business; we do consider clandestine actions as a last resort. But frankly, there aren’t many people skilled enough to assassinate Prince Aslan.”</p>
<p id="line_137">Prince Aslan was an A rank adventurer, and one of the top-tier within that rank. Frankly speaking, he was said to be on par with, or perhaps even more powerful than, Shizu-san.</p>
<p id="line_138">“Is he really that strong?”</p>
<p id="line_139">“Yes. He’s effectively in the Special A rank. That’s why he has such rizz.”</p>
<p id="line_140">“Then, if someone were to try to deal with him in secret…”</p>
<p id="line_141">“It would certainly be discovered. While it might be possible to kill him, it would definitely escalate into a major issue. The number of casualties would be uncertain, and the risk of failure is high. It’s a method I would never choose.”</p>
<p id="line_142">I felt a sense of relief hearing that. In the first place, even though there were several A rank adventurers in the Free Guild, it was unlikely that anyone would agree to assist in assassinating Prince Aslan. Reflecting on it, this seemed natural. Taking down someone with such strength and renown, especially a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> figure, would involve extraordinary consequences.</p>
<p id="line_143">“Making such a request would undermine my own credibility,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p id="line_144">If that was the case, what exactly was the nature of the request?</p>
<p id="line_145">“Sorry for interrupting. So, what is it that you want me to do?”</p>
<p id="line_146">“I’d like to ask for your help in supporting a certain adventurer,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said. “His name is Paulo. He’s quite skilled, though still relatively unknown. A few days ago, he took the A rank promotion exam, and I’m considering approving his promotion.”</p>
<p id="line_147">“Hmm.”</p>
<p id="line_148">“I want you to work with Paulo to infiltrate the Kingdom of Coleus and gather information on both factions.”</p>
<p id="line_149">“Just gathering information?”</p>
<p id="line_150">“Yes, that’s right. In such investigations, working alone might attract attention. Plus, being an A rank adventurer with a known reputation could raise suspicions. So, I’m looking for someone skilled yet inconspicuous.”</p>
<p id="line_151">Well, officially I was only B-plus in rank. So, in terms of not being widely known, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s point made sense.</p>
<p id="line_152">“I see. What kind of person is this Paulo?”</p>
<p id="line_153">“He’s a young man from the countryside, so dealing with intricate schemes might be challenging for him. I don’t think he can handle negotiations with nobles well, so I was thinking of having him infiltrate Aslan’s faction to gather information.”</p>
<p id="line_154">“So, I should infiltrate Crown Prince Sauzer’s faction, right?”</p>
<p id="line_155">“If you can manage that, it would be ideal. At the very least, gathering rumors and gossip could provide insight into which side to support.”</p>
<p id="line_156">I felt relieved to hear that. I wasn’t good at negotiating with nobles either. At any rate, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was certainly cautious. He was not only considering military strength but also evaluating the principles and legitimacy of each faction to determine which one to support.</p>
<p id="line_157">“Hmm, I see… So, depending on the situation, you’re considering teaming up with Prince Aslan as well?”</p>
<p id="line_158">“That’s correct. It’s unfortunate they declared independence, but I’m considering that possibility. If they eventually rejoin the Guild, it would restore our credibility. I’ve judged that this would be more beneficial than imposing sanctions.”</p>
<p id="line_159">“If you determine that Crown Prince Sauzer has legitimacy?”</p>
<p id="line_160">“In that case, I would openly ally with Crown Prince Sauzer and aim to overthrow Prince Aslan. Of course, the potential consequences of losing such a gamble would be severe, so it’s a matter that requires careful consideration.”</p>
<p id="line_161">That made sense. He was not just siding with whoever seemed likely to win, so I really respected that.</p>
<p id="line_162">“So, I should gather the evidence for your assessment?”</p>
<p id="line_163">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, you’re skilled in disguises, right? Gathering information should be right up your alley,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said with a smirk, provoking me.</p>
<p id="line_164">Well, I did enjoy spy movies and had always admired detectives, so the idea did sound intriguing. If I used my skills effectively, investigating the situation shouldn’t be a problem, so it wouldn’t hurt taking that role.</p>
<p id="line_165">“Got it. I’d be reluctant for a long-term assignment, but gathering information shouldn’t take too long. If it’s just during the school’s summer break, I can take on the task.”</p>
<p id="line_166">“That works for me. I’ll discuss it with Tiss-sensei tomorrow, so please focus on the mission!”</p>
<p id="line_167"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed pleased with my agreement. Although I wasn’t sure how much I could contribute, I decided to give it my best effort.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_168">The next day, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> visited the school as the board chairman and discussed the summer vacation classes with Tiss-sensei.</p>
<p id="line_169">“Instead of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, I’d like you to take over the S class, Tiss-sensei. Before the formal handover, please conduct several classes. The children trust you, so it should be fine to entrust it to you, right?”</p>
<p id="line_170">“Yes! It’s a great opportunity, so I’d be happy to take care of it.”</p>
<p id="line_171">Tiss-sensei nodded with a bright smile. Perhaps gaining confidence from the recent outdoor training, her expression was bright.</p>
<p id="line_172">“By the way, what are your plans, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei?”</p>
<p id="line_173">The one who interjected was Jeff-sensei. This guy saw me as his rival, as always. But well, it didn’t matter this time.</p>
<p id="line_174">“Well, you know, since it’s a great opportunity, I’m thinking of doing some sightseeing. I’ve been taking care of the S class all this time and haven’t been able to take a proper break even on holidays.”</p>
<p id="line_175">Well, half of that was true, and half was a lie. I actually relaxed quite a bit on my days off, and I made sure to take breaks. Since I didn’t need sleep, I always managed to carve out time for myself. That aside, the part about sightseeing is a lie.</p>
<p id="line_176"><em>It can’t be helped; I can’t tell the truth about this one.</em> Just when I thought that, Jeff-sensei said something unexpected.</p>
<p id="line_177">“If that’s the case, could you spare some time this afternoon?”</p>
<p id="line_178">Hm? I thought it was his usual snide remark, but what was going on?</p>
<p id="line_179">“I’m leaving on a journey starting tomorrow, so I thought I should get ready…”</p>
<p id="line_180">I said trying to avoid giving a direct answer. At that moment, Jeff-sensei flashed a confident smile and said something that made me uneasy.</p>
<p id="line_181">“In that case, how about visiting the Kingdom of Coleus? Although it’s close to the desert and known to be hot, it’s surprisingly comfortable in midsummer. The nights get chilly, so it’s well-known among the nobility as a summer retreat.”</p>
<p id="line_182">“He-hehhh… Is that so…”</p>
<p id="line_183">“I don’t know where you plan to relax, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, but I have connections in the Kingdom of Coleus. I owe you for treating my sister’s illness, so if you have the time, I can write a letter of introduction for you.”</p>
<p id="line_184">Whether it was coincidence or if he knew something, I couldn’t read Jeff-sensei’s expression. He seemed genuinely noble at that moment, and I reconsidered my opinion of him.</p>
<p id="line_185">When I glanced at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he was also smiling.</p>
<p id="line_186">“That sounds great! In that case, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, why not take up Jeff-sensei’s offer?”</p>
<p id="line_187"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with an innocent look that seemed to say, “You didn’t have a destination in mind anyway, right?” casually remarked. Whatever Jeff-sensei’s intentions were, at this point, I had no choice but to go along with it.</p>
<p id="line_188">“If that’s the case, then I appreciate it. No, I’m really looking forward to it!”</p>
<p id="line_189">“Hahaha, I’m delighted to be of service. Well then, after lunch, I’ll guide you to my residence.”</p>
<p id="line_190">With those words, Jeff-sensei left for his class.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_191">The three of us—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Tiss-sensei, and I—briefed the children on the changes. Since it was so soon after yesterday’s announcement, the kids were still trying to act nonchalant.</p>
<p id="line_192">“Heh, we’re totally fine without <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei.”</p>
<p id="line_193">“Yeah, just make sure you enjoy your vacation to the fullest!”</p>
<p id="line_194">“We’re really looking forward to Tiss-sensei’s classes!”</p>
<p id="line_195">Grr… These guys were taking this opportunity to rub it in.</p>
<p id="line_196">“I-I really liked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei’s classes, but even you need a break.” Chloe comforted me.</p>
<p id="line_197">“Take care, Sensei.”</p>
<p id="line_198"><em>Gale, I won’t forget your kindness.</em></p>
<p id="line_199">“Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, leave the rest to me!” Tiss-sensei said with a reassuring smile.</p>
<p id="line_200">With that, we parted ways. I planned to hold a farewell party when I returned. Afterward, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I left the academy and visited Jeff-sensei’s residence.</p>
<p id="line_201">“I apologize for the wait. Let’s prepare the introduction letter now. My relative is married into the Kingdom of Coleus, so they should be able to accommodate you. What name should I put on it?”</p>
<p id="line_202">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_203">“Oh, are you pretending to be clueless? Do you plan to conduct an undercover investigation while keeping the name <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_204"><em>Hey, hey, we’re totally busted.</em></p>
<p id="line_205">“As expected of Jeff-sensei. How did you figure it out?”</p>
<p id="line_206"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, and Jeff-sensei replied with a hint of irritation, “I’d appreciate it if the chairman didn’t mock me as well.”</p>
<p id="line_207">“I’ve looked into <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei’s background. My best subordinates couldn’t find anything beyond the Kingdom of Blumund. But around the same time, a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nation emerged in the Great Forest of Jura. Doesn’t it seem unreasonable to think these events are unrelated?”</p>
<p id="line_208">“Y-you’re sharp,” I said.</p>
<p id="line_209">“Hahhh, that’s the problem. Even if I’m right, you should have pretended not to know. If you don’t admit it, it stays as mere speculation, and you can avoid the issue altogether. But maybe that’s what makes you who you are, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei. It might not be very noble, but I find it rather admirable.”</p>
<p id="line_210">“Oh, really? I thought you disliked me…”</p>
<p id="line_211">“Hmph! There’s no reason to dislike someone who saved my sister. Anyway, let’s move on. The important thing is that you have many openings, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei.”</p>
<p id="line_212">It was an unexpected comment, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to agree. When I glanced sideways, I noticed him nodding in agreement with Jeff-sensei. I thought to myself, <em>Good grief</em>, and then said, “I’ll be more careful from now on.”</p>
<p id="line_213">“Yes, please do. Even nobles like me, who have distanced themselves from the political world, find this level of investigation simple. Keep that in mind. Even if you’re outstanding as an adventurer, that alone won’t get you through life. So, what will your false name be?”</p>
<p id="line_214">Jeff-sensei sat at his desk, writing the introduction letter as he offered this advice. I had thought of him as just a disagreeable person, but it seemed I had misunderstood. I reflected on his words and began considering what false name to use.</p>
<p id="line_215">As Jeff-sensei suggested, using a false name seemed like the better option. Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as a B-plus adventurer, wasn’t widely known, if it were discovered that I was the ruler of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nation, it could lead to major complications.</p>
<p id="line_216">If that was the case…</p>
<p id="line_217">“Then, Satoru.”</p>
<p id="line_218">“Satoru? Hmph, let’s go with that. Here, the introduction letter is ready.” Jeff-sensei handed me the letter.</p>
<p id="line_219">“Thank you.”</p>
<p id="line_220">“This is just a token of appreciation, so please don’t worry about it. My relative is Marquis Jahil, a noble in the Kingdom of Coleus. He should be able to provide you food and lodging for about two weeks. Understand, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei? The introduction I’m making is for a teacher named ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ I’ve noted that you are a B-plus adventurer and also my benefactor.”</p>
<p id="line_221">“Not under my false name?”</p>
<p id="line_222">“Of course. It means that any investigation conducted by someone of unknown identity like Satoru is not within my or Marquis Jahil’s concern. You should be able to enter the country using your adventurer’s credentials, so proceed confidently to the Marquis’s estate. I’ve also noted that you should not be hindered in your actions, so feel free to do as you please. However—”</p>
<p id="line_223">“I’ll act as Satoru while out to avoid causing any trouble for the Marquis.”</p>
<p id="line_224">“Very well.” Jeff-sensei nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_225">“Shall we prepare identification for Satoru as well?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suggested. “It might be wise to have a disguise while we’re at it.”</p>
<p id="line_226"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to agree with the idea of using a false name. I accepted the offer and received a guild card under the name “Satoru.”</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_227">After obtaining the introduction letter and identification, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> led me to a tavern. It was a place where the second and third floors served as an inn, popular among mid-level and higher adventurers. The tavern was cleaner than I had expected. Since it was frequented by those with money, it seemed well-maintained.</p>
<p id="line_228"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> headed straight to a table in the back where a slender yet muscular man with a trademark spiked short hair was seated. He was wearing light leather armor protecting his torso and had metal fittings on his hands and knees. He had chest-protecting armor beside him, but no weapon in sight. Upon closer inspection, the base of his gloves was metal-plated. It seemed this man was the type to fight bare-handed</p>
<p id="line_229">“Hey there! Sorry to keep you waiting, Paulo.”</p>
<p id="line_230">With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s greeting, it became clear that the man was Paulo. Since I was supposed to support him, I decided to observe his character and demeanor closely.</p>
<p id="line_231">Paulo stood up in surprise and exclaimed, “Guild Master! Did you come all this way just for me?”</p>
<p id="line_232">While his reaction might have seemed exaggerated, it was a typical response. Though friendly from my perspective, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a prominent figure.</p>
<p id="line_233">“Hahaha, of course. Paulo, you performed exceptionally well in the assessment. Your skills clearly rank you as an A rank adventurer.”</p>
<p id="line_234">“Oohhh, thank you so much!”</p>
<p id="line_235">“But, you see…”</p>
<p id="line_236">“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p id="line_237">“No, your combat skills were impressive, but I’m wondering how they translate in real battles.”</p>
<p id="line_238">“Real…battles?”</p>
<p id="line_239">“Yeah. I have a task for you, and I’ll evaluate your performance based on the results.”</p>
<p id="line_240">As I was thinking that it might be better to let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> take the lead in conversations in front of Paulo, that very conversation was unfolding. <em>Paulo-san, you’re being deceived, you know?</em> Paulo seemed completely caught up in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s pace, making me want to interject and point it out.</p>
<p id="line_241">“I-I see…”</p>
<p id="line_242">Leaving behind the bewildered Paulo, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> ordered drinks and food, then gestured for both Paulo and me to sit down.</p>
<p id="line_243">“May I know who this person is?”</p>
<p id="line_244">“Oh, I haven’t introduced him yet, have I? This is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, my benefactor. He’s a B-plus rank adventurer, and I’ve asked him to assist you with this mission.”</p>
<p id="line_245"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> introduced me as his benefactor. It seemed that meant I wouldn’t have to speak formally or use honorifics.</p>
<p id="line_246">“Nice to meet you, I’m <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” I greeted him with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_247">“I’m Paulo. I’m an A- rank in the Extermination Division and currently attempting my third trial.”</p>
<p id="line_248">Paulo nodded and introduced himself as well. At first glance, he didn’t seem pretentious; rather, he came across as straightforward.</p>
<p id="line_249">“I’m also technically part of the Extermination Division.”</p>
<p id="line_250">“Hahaha, yes, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was promoted through a request to collect Baffledils. But you know, Paulo, his skills are definitely reliable, so you can trust him.”</p>
<p id="line_251">“If someone is recognized by you, Grandmaster, I wouldn’t doubt their abilities.”</p>
<p id="line_252">With the introductions out of the way, alcohol and dishes arrived. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had developed significantly, with flavors comparable to those from my past life. The beer, served cold, had a slightly strong bitterness but was quite tasty. The only drawback was the limited variety, but complaining about it seemed like it would bring bad luck.</p>
<p id="line_253">We clinked our wooden tankards together and toasted. As we settled back, Paulo began to speak. “So, about what we were discussing earlier—could you tell me more about this request?”</p>
<p id="line_254">He seemed quite concerned, aware that his promotion was at stake. He also appeared to realize my involvement in the request, as his gaze flickered toward me intermittently.</p>
<p id="line_255">“Of course,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> replied, then started explaining the details to Paulo as we enjoyed our meal.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_256">I became concerned about the possibility of information leakage, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, commanding a formidable group of seasoned experts, reassured me. Without me noticing, a soundproofing spell had been activated. This curious magic prevented conversations from being overheard by others nearby but allowed orders to be heard clearly.</p>
<p id="line_257">«Report. This is the elemental magic: Airflow Shut. It was not activated by Individual: <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kagurazaka but by the person on the other side of the counter.»</p>
<p id="line_258">Ah, now that I thought about it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t use magic. So, this must be a place secured by the Free Guild specifically for confidential discussions. <em>I see it now</em>. Impressed by how far <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s influence extended, I decided to listen carefully to his explanation.</p>
<p id="line_259">The explanation was consistent with what I had already been told, and Paulo seemed to accept it readily. As soon as the explanation was complete, Paulo nodded vigorously.</p>
<p id="line_260">“Got it. My job is to find out what this Aslan guy is planning, right?!”</p>
<p id="line_261">Despite showing respect towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Paulo referred to Aslan, a prince of a country, without any honorifics. It seemed Paulo had a surprisingly rough edge to him. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to notice this too, and with a wry smile, he pointed it out.</p>
<p id="line_262">“That’s right, but remember, you’re dealing with royalty. Show more respect, or you’ll find it difficult to get close.”</p>
<p id="line_263">“I-I see. Understood, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>
<p id="line_264">Paulo nodded firmly, though I wondered if it would be enough. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must have thought the same thing because he shrugged at me.</p>
<p id="line_265">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, Paulo is like this, so I’d appreciate any advice you can give him.”</p>
<p id="line_266">“O-okay.”</p>
<p id="line_267">Though I agreed about the concern for Paulo, I wasn’t particularly skilled in undercover investigations myself. In fact, I had never done anything like that before. Just because someone enjoyed spy movies didn’t necessarily mean they were adept at them.</p>
<p id="line_268">“Didn’t you say you’re <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or something? I trust you since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san introduced you. Well, I’m counting on you!” Paulo said pompously.</p>
<p id="line_269">“I’m supposed to be the support guy, right?”</p>
<p id="line_270">“What are you talking about? Paulo handles combat, and you are in charge of strategy, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>
<p id="line_271">“No, no, no. Normally, it would make sense for Paulo to take the lead!”</p>
<p id="line_272">“Yeah, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I’m not great with details. I’ll follow your lead, so help me become A rank, alright?”</p>
<p id="line_273"><em>He’s quite laid-back, isn’t he? Well, that’s alright, but…</em></p>
<p id="line_274">“A rank” referred to those who had attempted the A rank exam several times and were judged to have skills close to A rank. Officially, they were considered equivalent to B-plus rank, with no official hierarchy between them. In terms of recognized abilities, there was no doubt Paulo was superior. If we undertook the same mission, it would naturally make sense for him to take the lead. Yet somehow, I ended up being appointed as the person in charge.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_275"><em>Well, que sera, sera</em>—with that mindset, the two of us prepared and departed from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, a major problem soon emerged. It turned out that Paulo was even less capable than I had anticipated. I also had to arrange the transportation to reach our destination, the country of Coleus. Taking a shared carriage would take over a week, and we couldn’t afford to spend that much time. So, I decided to pull out all the stops and make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p id="line_276">The carriage I had used to travel to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was given to Kaval’s party, and the camper van was now being used by the children as a donation to the academy. So, I decided to modify the prototype two-seater for our use. Naturally, Ranga would be pulling it. I was impressed by Paulo, who boarded with a nonchalant look, thinking he was a bigger deal than I had imagined. Normally, I’d be more critical, but I found myself reassessing Paulo a bit.</p>
<p id="line_277">“My lord, it seems we’re nearing the next country!” Ranga announced as he pulled the carriage along.</p>
<p id="line_278">With the increasing number of travelers passing by, I figured we would arrive soon.</p>
<p id="line_279">“Got it, thanks. Let’s put away the carriage and proceed on foot,” I said, waking up the dozing Paulo beside me.</p>
<p id="line_280">“Hrmmm, are we already there?”</p>
<p id="line_281">“Not yet. From here, we’ll walk toward the town.”</p>
<p id="line_282">“Such a hassle. Can’t we just go in like this?”</p>
<p id="line_283">“Of course not! Ranga would stand out because he’s a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_284">“That’s right, human. Make sure you don’t cause trouble for my lord!”</p>
<p id="line_285">“Y-yeah, got it.”</p>
<p id="line_286">Paulo turned out to be quite hopeless. Seeing him being scolded even by Ranga made me want to hit myself for my earlier admiration of him as a significant figure.</p>
<p id="line_287">“By the way, I thought this dog was unusually big, but did it just talk now?”</p>
<p id="line_288"><em>Yeah he talks!</em></p>
<p id="line_289">Wait, didn’t I just explain that he was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?! I sighed deeply in exasperation. Ranga fell silent too, looking at me with a troubled expression. I shook my head and decided to stop worrying about Paulo. Things only got more challenging once we entered the town. We decided to stay at an inn, where yet another difficult truth came to light.</p>
<p id="line_290">“Oh, this inn looks pretty good. By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, are we okay on money?”</p>
<p id="line_291">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_292">Hey hey, wait a minute, could it be…?</p>
<p id="line_293">“Paulo-san, just to let you know—”</p>
<p id="line_294">“What is it?”</p>
<p id="line_295">“We’re getting separate rooms, so we’ll be paying separately too.”</p>
<p id="line_296">“Wait a minute. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, you’re supposed to be looking after me on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s behalf, right?”</p>
<p id="line_297">“Support and a bit of looking out, sure, but not paying for you!”</p>
<p id="line_298">I wanted to say, “Cut it out already.”</p>
<p id="line_299">I’d been saving up my teaching salary bit by bit, building up my nest egg. It was hard to accept spending most of it on someone who was practically a stranger.</p>
<p id="line_300">“That’s not the point. It’s not something to brag about, but I don’t have money.”</p>
<p id="line_301">No, that wasn’t the conversation we were having. Like at all.</p>
<p id="line_302">“Are you kidding me?! You’re supposed to be a provisional A-minus rank, a top-notch adventurer. How come you’re broke?”</p>
<p id="line_303">It was strange for someone considered top-notch even at B rank to be struggling with money. While there were exceptions like Kaval’s party, the idea of him being completely broke was hard to fathom.</p>
<p id="line_304">“Hahaha,” Paulo laughed loudly, unfazed by the situation. “Don’t be so angry. Honestly, in a big city like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I get a bit carried away. I spent all my money during the break between exams.”</p>
<p id="line_305"><em>Man, this guy…</em> Paulo’s standing in my eyes took a nosedive. Complaining to him wouldn’t solve anything, so despite my frustration, I had no choice but to cover for him this time. I negotiated with the innkeeper and managed to get Paulo into the cheapest room available.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_306">And so, we continued our journey westward. After staying two nights at our next stop, we expected to reach our destination by evening on the third day.</p>
<p id="line_307">“Listen, Paulo. Tonight is different from last night. We’re staying at a noble’s mansion, so be on your best behavior.”</p>
<p id="line_308">“Got it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>
<p id="line_309">As you could tell from this exchange, the roles between me and Paulo had completely reversed. Having reached my limit of tolerance, my usually gentle self finally took action against Paulo. I couldn’t get through to him, even after explaining things gently. I mean, this guy tried to take on a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bare-handed.</p>
<p id="line_310">………</p>
<p id="line_311">……</p>
<p id="line_312">…</p>
<p id="line_313">That was the story from this morning. Thanks to Ranga, we managed to enter the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Coleus earlier than planned.</p>
<p id="line_314">The scenery changed, and the temperature rose. The landscape began to resemble the Silk Road from my past life. We passed through grasslands and encountered rugged terrain with rocky mountains ahead. Continuing like this, we’d soon enter the desert area.</p>
<p id="line_315">The Kingdom of Coleus is also known as the Kingdom of Hot Sands, so we made sure to prepare accordingly in the town where we stayed. Paulo, being lightly dressed, was fine, but I changed into summer clothes and got a white hood to protect myself from the direct sunlight.</p>
<p id="line_316">To be honest, I didn’t really need it, but I bought it to hide the unnaturalness of my appearance. It was quite pricey, so it felt wasteful to get one for Paulo, but I thought it wouldn’t be mature to only get one for myself, so I reluctantly bought two. I planned to later collect reimbursement from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for it.</p>
<p id="line_317">While I was immersed in a nostalgic mood and enjoying the scenery, I realized I had let my guard down a bit too much. Naturally, security had also gotten worse.</p>
<p id="line_318">The main road felt more like a trade route trodden by travelers. There were patrolling soldiers, but they weren’t stationed permanently, so if you were unlucky, you might encounter bandits, smugglers, or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_319">Merchants typically hired adventurers for protection as a countermeasure. In our case, it went without saying that we had to handle it ourselves.</p>
<p id="line_320">And yet…</p>
<p id="line_321">“I am Paulo the ‘Bare Fist.’ If you value your life, leave quietly!”</p>
<p id="line_322">Watching Paulo boast like that, I couldn’t help but feel perplexed. As part of our division of roles, Paulo handled combat. While I was a bit concerned that he didn’t carry any weapons, I was impressed and a bit intimidated by his style of fighting bare-handed, especially against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, this wasn’t quite the same scenario.</p>
<p id="line_323">If the opponent were just thieves, I might have stayed silent and let Paulo handle it. But this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p id="line_324">«Report: It is B-plus rank equivalent to the Evil Centipede. Beware, however, that its body surface is covered in highly acidic venom, so be careful of splashes during physical attacks.»</p>
<p id="line_325">The creature that appeared was a poison lizard - a vicious <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with a powerful poison covering its body. It was no threat to me, but to Paulo, it was a formidable opponent. It should have been crystal clear, even to him, what would happen if he hit such a creature with his bare hands.</p>
<p id="line_326">“Hey, Paulo-san. That thing is very pois—”</p>
<p id="line_327">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, don’t worry. I’ll show you what I’m capable of! Die, you <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! Knuckle Rush—!!”</p>
<p id="line_328"><em>He done did it!</em></p>
<p id="line_329">This idiot ignored my advice completely and launched his attack. I couldn’t help but think, <em>Is he acoustic?</em></p>
<p id="line_330">The result was, of course—</p>
<p id="line_331">“Guaaaaah, my eyes! My face feels hot!”</p>
<p id="line_332">Paulo was thrashing around, having been splashed with the Poison Lizard’s bodily fluid—vicious poison.</p>
<p id="line_333">I was also speechless at the painfully obvious outcome.</p>
<p id="line_334"><em>At least, the Poison Lizard did die, though. The Knuckle Rush is more powerful than I thought, so I have to reassess that. But still, if you end up seriously injuring yourself too, then it is all meaningless!</em></p>
<p id="line_335">I took a deep breath. I had many thoughts racing through my mind, but leaving things as they were would be bad. Paulo’s face was badly burned, and he was at risk of losing his sight. I had no choice but to heal him with a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="full potion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_336">“Sit.”</p>
<p id="line_337">“Th-thanks, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I owe you one.”</p>
<p id="line_338">“I said you to sit down!”</p>
<p id="line_339"><em>Do a seiza, seiza!</em></p>
<p id="line_340">I intimidated Paulo, who was just standing there.</p>
<p id="line_341">“Grrrr. My master commands it: human, sit down.”</p>
<p id="line_342">Ranga joined in to intimidate as well.</p>
<p id="line_343">Paulo, who didn’t know what seiza was, was overwhelmed by our insistence and sat down on the spot.</p>
<p id="line_344"><em>Well, whatever</em>. I took the opportunity to lecture him seriously. “Don’t be reckless. Focus on what you can do effectively!”</p>
<p id="line_345">After making Paulo aware of his recklessness, I took a closer look at his situation.</p>
<p id="line_346">Mainly concerning his combat style, Paulo excelled in unarmed combat and staff techniques, but when I suggested he use a weapon, I discovered he only had a wooden stick—which had broken. He’d been fighting with just his fists ever since. When I asked if he had bought a new one, he said he didn’t think it was necessary. I was astounded.</p>
<p id="line_347">I thought it was unacceptable for someone who prided themselves on being a combat professional to not have a variety of combat options against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_348">“You know, this is a big service I’m doing for you…”</p>
<p id="line_349">I really didn’t feel any guardian responsibility for him, but I couldn’t help feeling sorry for leaving him in such a predicament. Despite Paulo’s lack of foresight, he wasn’t a bad person. Over these three days, I had started to feel some sympathy for him.</p>
<p id="line_350">So, I took some magisteel from my Stomach and made a weapon specifically for Paulo. It was a six-foot long staff, about his height. It resembled the magic staff wielded by Sun Wukong, perhaps because this setting was reminiscent of the world of <em>Journey to the West</em>, but unlike that legendary weapon, it didn’t change size at will, so it required careful handling.</p>
<p id="line_351">The staff had a diameter of about three centimeters and was reasonably heavy. However, Paulo handled it with ease, swinging it around effortlessly.</p>
<p id="line_352">“Wow, this is awesome!” Paulo exclaimed as he demonstrated his own style with great joy.</p>
<p id="line_353">He did look quite impressive. Being made of magisteel, the staff was incredibly strong and should complement Paulo’s Battlewill well, making it a formidable weapon.</p>
<p id="line_354">I also gave him a healing potion. With this, as long as he didn’t suffer instant death, he should be fine.</p>
<p id="line_355">“Use it carefully.”</p>
<p id="line_356">“Got it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san!”</p>
<p id="line_357">And so, I found myself growing closer to Paulo than I had initially anticipated.</p>
<p id="line_358">………</p>
<p id="line_359">……</p>
<p id="line_360">…</p>
<p id="line_361">Since Paulo started listening to my advice, I felt a bit relieved. Jeff-sensei had introduced me kindly, so I couldn’t overlook any rudeness or ingratitude.</p>
<p id="line_362">As I emphasized this to Paulo, Ranga continued running. The atmosphere shifted once again.</p>
<p id="line_363">“We’ve entered the desert,” I observed.</p>
<p id="line_364">“It seems so,” Ranga agreed.</p>
<p id="line_365">Ahead, traveling by carriage was no longer feasible. Ranga could create footholds in the air with his special skill, Wind Manipulation, allowing him to navigate the desert terrain. So, we switched to a makeshift sled.</p>
<p id="line_366">The sled had two seats—one for me at the front and one for Paulo in the back. Although we couldn’t carry luggage, this setup was advantageous since we didn’t have to worry about it.</p>
<p id="line_367">“Go, Ranga!” I commanded.</p>
<p id="line_368">“Understood!” Ranga replied, picking up speed across the sand.</p>
<p id="line_369">Much sooner than anticipated, we saw the capital of the Kingdom of Coleus, Herbaria, in the distance. I kept Ranga in the shadows as we entered the city through the outer walls.</p>
<p id="line_370">At the checkpoint, our identities were verified. Once the soldiers realized we were high-ranking adventurers, their attitude changed. One of them took the introduction letter and quickly went to relay the message.</p>
<p id="line_371">We were informed that a carriage would soon arrive to pick us up, and we were escorted to a waiting room. The treatment was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p id="line_372">After waiting for just under twenty minutes, we were guided by the arriving escort and reached our destination.</p>

<h1 class="ch-number">Story 6</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Coleus’s Dream Part 2</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_374">“Thank you for saving my elder sister.”</p>
<p id="line_375">The woman who greeted me in front of the large mansion was young and beautiful. The older sister she referred to was Ulamuth-san, Count Guratol’s wife. Unbelievably, this meant that the person before me was Jeff-sensei’s younger sister.</p>
<p id="line_376">So, when Jeff-sensei mentioned having connections, it was because his own sister had married into this family. It dawned on me that the old man might have sent me here because he sensed something ominous in the Kingdom of Coleus. He likely wanted me to work for the sake of his younger sister.</p>
<p id="line_377">Just like with Baron Velyard, it was frustrating how Jeff-sensei made me owe him a favor without revealing his true intentions. This is how nobles operate… I felt defeated once again. However, I couldn’t ignore the fact that this request was also beneficial to me. Given the situation, I decided to cooperate as much as I could.</p>
<p id="line_378">“My name is Chiffon, Chiffon Jahil. I am Count Jeff Irigal’s younger sister and the first wife of Barak Jahil,” she introduced herself, bowing politely.</p>
<p id="line_379">Paulo was clearly captivated by her beauty. Her tanned brown skin radiated health, and her glossy golden hair shimmered in the light. Though Ulamuth-san was still recovering from an illness and was undeniably beautiful, Chiffon-san was not outdone. Her youth and vitality seemed to surpass her, even.</p>
<p id="line_380">“I’m Paulo! Believe it or not, I’m an A-minus rank adventurer.”</p>
<p id="line_381">Paulo pushed me aside to introduce himself. Chiffon-san was indeed beautiful, but she was a married woman. I couldn’t help but worry if Paulo understood that. However, it seemed my concern was unnecessary.</p>
<p id="line_382">“Well, that’s wonderful. We would be delighted to entertain you at our humble abode, so please make yourself at home,” Chiffon-san replied with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_383">She then called for the servants and had Paulo escorted to a guest room. Paulo didn’t have a chance to say a word against that forceful attitude.</p>
<p id="line_384">“Uh, um…”</p>
<p id="line_385">He was whisked away by the muscular servants, who appeared to have high combat abilities—likely just under B rank. Even for Paulo, facing several of them would be a challenge. He cast a reluctant glance back as he was led away.</p>
<p id="line_386">“Phew, now that the nuisance is gone,” Chiffon-san said, her tone shifting. “We’ve prepared a guest room for you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, but first, please enjoy our house’s pride—the onsen and sauna. I’ll inform you when my husband returns, so until then, please relax.”</p>
<p id="line_387">Chiffon-san’s demeanor quickly changed as she treated me with great courtesy. Taking her words to heart, I decided to relieve my travel fatigue.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_388">Here in Herbaria, the town surrounded an oasis. The spring that bubbled up in the center was a natural hot spring, more wonderful than I had imagined. There was a sun-heated sandpit, a small artificial spring, a sauna, a cold bath, a sand bath, an indoor bath, and even an open-air bath. Considering that all of these were privately owned, it was clear how powerful and influential the House of Marquis Jahil truly was.</p>
<p id="line_389">Securing a water source in the desert was equivalent to holding the lives of everyone in the surrounding area.</p>
<p id="line_390">“Wow, I’m amazed at how extensive Jeff-sensei’s connections are,” I muttered, feeling relaxed for the first time in a while as I enjoyed the various baths.</p>
<p id="line_391">After I had finished bathing, Chiffon-san came over. “My husband has returned, so I’m here to inform you. We’ve also prepared a meal, so if you wish, please join us.”</p>
<p id="line_392">Following her guidance, I arrived at the great hall. A long table was lined with a sumptuous feast. There were no chairs, only cushions with backrests on the carpeted floor, similar to floor chairs. My honest impression was that it must be difficult to keep clean.</p>
<p id="line_393">At the head of the table sat a dignified man with red hair and brown skin. He stood up when he saw me.</p>
<p id="line_394">“Welcome, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono. I’m glad to have you here.”</p>
<p id="line_395">The man addressing me must be Barak Jahil, the head of the house. Despite being in his early twenties, he exuded a remarkably strong presence. I could tell immediately that he was stronger than Paulo.</p>
<p id="line_396">“Thank you very much. Should I address you as Marquis Jahil?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_397">“Barak is fine. You are a benefactor to my wife, which makes you a benefactor to me as well. There’s no need for formality between us,” Barak replied with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p id="line_398">I immediately sensed that he was a very genuine person.</p>
<p id="line_399">Chiffon-san was the only other person seated at the table.</p>
<p id="line_400">“Huh? Where’s Paulo?” I inquired.</p>
<p id="line_401">Barak answered, “That man is a warrior, but he lacks refinement. While he may be valuable on the battlefield, he’s not suited to be a guest in this household. Since he’s with you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, we will provide him with a roof, but there’s no obligation to lavish him with hospitality.”</p>
<p id="line_402">His statement was perfectly reasonable. In fact, I hadn’t expected to be treated so well myself.</p>
<p id="line_403">“Rest assured, we’ve prepared a meal for him,” Chiffon-san said.</p>
<p id="line_404"><em>If that’s the case, then I guess there’s no problem?</em></p>
<p id="line_405">I wasn’t Paulo’s guardian, and he was an adult capable of taking care of himself. With that in mind, I pushed thoughts of Paulo out of my mind.</p>
<p id="line_406">It was time to eat. When the curtain at the front of the great hall was raised, a band that had been waiting there began to play. Dancers appeared, performing a martial dance as if engaged in a real battle.</p>
<p id="line_407">They were both beautiful and skilled, with strength equivalent to B rank adventurers. These dancers served as both Chiffon-san’s maids and bodyguards. I appreciated the effort they put into entertaining me, as the martial dance was said to be a rare performance.</p>
<p id="line_408">I thoroughly enjoyed the exotic cuisine while watching the captivating songs and dances.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_409">After enjoying a delicious dinner and a pleasant evening, it was time for a more serious discussion. We moved to a room designated for private talks.</p>
<p id="line_410">Seated on a U-shaped sofa were myself and the Jahil couple. Barak, who had been sipping on some alcohol, showed no signs of inebriation. He fixed me with a sharp gaze and asked in a heavy tone, “Now then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono. I prefer to get straight to the point. I’ll ask plainly: have you come to take Chiffon away?”</p>
<p id="line_411"><em>Uhm?</em></p>
<p id="line_412">I was momentarily taken aback by the question. It was different from what I had expected, but after a moment of thought, I understood.</p>
<p id="line_413">“Ah, I see. You thought I came to take Chiffon-san away at Jeff-sensei’s request.”</p>
<p id="line_414">“Is that not the case? Despite how my brother appears, he is very kind to his family. I assumed that was the purpose of your visit…”</p>
<p id="line_415">While Jeff-sensei might have had such intentions, I hadn’t heard anything about it. I answered clearly, “No.”</p>
<p id="line_416">Although the Jahil couple still seemed unconvinced, the husband—Barak-san—shifted his attitude and spoke.</p>
<p id="line_417">“Hmm. If that’s not the case, then your purpose must be related to the Free Guild. The tension in our country is surely known to the higher-ups of other nations.”</p>
<p id="line_418">“Yes, indeed. Our country receives aid from various nations in exchange for our role as the guardian of the extreme end. From a security standpoint, they must view the current situation as unfavorable.”</p>
<p id="line_419">Following her husband’s lead, Chiffon-san also began discussing such matters. This reminded me of something.</p>
<p id="line_420">Before coming here, I had researched the Kingdom of Coleus, which served as a bulwark for the western nations. To the west stretched a barren wasteland, protecting humanity from the vicious <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the desert of death.</p>
<p id="line_421">The total population was just under five million. There was no distinction between citizens and Freemen; if you lived here, military service was mandatory. This included tasks like transporting supplies, so not everyone was directly involved in combat.</p>
<p id="line_422">However, most of the population was strong, and if motivated, they could assemble a military force numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Originally a harsh land with low domestic crop production, Coleus had managed to secure support from various countries through its battles with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, thereby maintaining its status as a nation.</p>
<p id="line_423">Therefore, what Chiffon-san said was accurate. An internal conflict in the Kingdom of Coleus would be unwelcome to neighboring countries. Even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t intervene, other nations would eventually step in to mediate.</p>
<p id="line_424">The Jahil couple was surely well aware of this. In that case, there was no point in trying to deceive them.</p>
<p id="line_425">“That’s correct. My purpose is to investigate which side the Free Guild will support. While we cannot condone Prince Aslan’s declaration of independence, depending on the situation, collaboration might be possible.”</p>
<p id="line_426">“Hmm. From my standpoint, that’s not something I can welcome.”</p>
<p id="line_427">“My husband is Prince Sauzer’s most trusted confidant, so please forgive his current statement.”</p>
<p id="line_428">From what I knew, Barak-san was the unifying force behind the faction supporting Prince Sauzer. He seemed to act as Prince Aslan’s counterpart and was considered the strongest warrior in the Kingdom of Coleus until a few years ago.</p>
<p id="line_429">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the kingdom versus the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the Free Guild—it seemed like a balanced match, despite my initial assumption that the Free Guild might be stronger. The potential for a dangerous confrontation was clear.</p>
<p id="line_430">I decided it was best to stay uninvolved and focus on gathering information from both sides.</p>
<p id="line_431">“No, I believe that’s a reasonable statement. However, my mission is to gather accurate information, not to determine which side to take. I hope you understand my position on that?”</p>
<p id="line_432">I made it clear that I had no affiliation with either side.</p>
<p id="line_433">“I understand. I won’t hinder your actions and might even cooperate. There’s no need for you to operate under a false name. Tomorrow, accompany me to the royal castle.”</p>
<p id="line_434"><em>No, no, I want to stay uninvolved.</em></p>
<p id="line_435">My apprehension was confirmed when Barak-san added, “I’ll introduce you to Prince Sauzer under my name. You’ll get the right answers from him as well.”</p>
<p id="line_436">That was the last thing I wanted.</p>
<p id="line_437">“No, no, thank you for your kind offer, but due to my position, I must decline.”</p>
<p id="line_438">I politely declined.</p>
<p id="line_439">It wasn’t about making a fair judgment. As the leader of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nation, I didn’t want to meet leaders from other countries. Handling royalty was delicate; a single misstep could lead to major complications. In fact, I had prepared a false name specifically to avoid such situations. The idea that my mere statement could escalate into an international issue was no laughing matter.</p>
<p id="line_440">“I see. It’s unfortunate, but I won’t insist. There was a letter from my brother-in-law urging respect for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono’s wishes.”</p>
<p id="line_441">Oh, I was relieved he backed down. I owed thanks to Jeff-sensei.</p>
<p id="line_442">But that was where I made a mistake—letting my guard down.</p>
<p id="line_443">While I had managed to avoid meeting the Crown Prince, the trap had another layer.</p>
<p id="line_444">“Well then! Please do meet Princess Zenobia as well. She is currently suffering from an illness. I’ve heard from my brother that you are a renowned doctor, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Even my brother, who rarely praises anyone, wrote in his letter, ‘Ulamuth was saved thanks to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei.’ I’m sure you’ll find a way to aid her recovery!” Chiffon-san said with a smile, catching me off guard with her announcement.</p>
<p id="line_445">It was unfortunate that Princess Zenobia was ill. Maybe, just maybe, I could help her.</p>
<p id="line_446">And because I was subconsciously thinking about it, Barak-san jumped on my unguarded moment without missing a beat.</p>
<p id="line_447">“So be it. You will guide <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono to Princess Zenobia’s room.”</p>
<p id="line_448">Just like that, the conversation was settled, and my schedule for tomorrow was set without any chance for me to interject.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_449">The next morning, I saw Paulo off.</p>
<p id="line_450">“But I haven’t done any investigation or anything!” he grumbled, but that was beside the point.</p>
<p id="line_451">“Just go. Head to the Free Guild’s tavern or wherever and ask why it’s closed. And then, you know, just complain about something.”</p>
<p id="line_452">“Complain?”</p>
<p id="line_453">“Yeah. Something like, ‘I came all this way as an escort for a noble’s acquaintance, but now I’m stuck in a bind because he’s so selfish.’ Just make up whatever you need.”</p>
<p id="line_454">“I see!” Paulo’s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p id="line_455">With that, he departed from the mansion in high spirits. I had given him some pocket money and told him he could enjoy drinking, so I doubted he’d remember much of what he heard there. But that was fine.</p>
<p id="line_456">From the start, I never expected Paulo to gather any useful information.</p>
<p id="line_457">‹<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, are you there?›</p>

They were stronger and more useful than horses.</p>
<p id="line_461">I was confident <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be able to operate effectively, and it seemed I was right.</p>
<p id="line_462">Incidentally, I no longer wore a mask even in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_464">‹Follow that man named Paulo and listen to all his conversations. If he gets attacked, assist him.›</p>
<p id="line_465">‹Understood!›</p>
<p id="line_466">With that, one of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Clones separated and disappeared into the shadows, while the remaining one sank into my own shadow. I marveled at how convenient this was and watched as the Clone left.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_467">With preparations complete, I waited for the Jahil couple. Today, they would pick me up and drop me off in the same carriage. In other words, there was no escape.</p>
<p id="line_468">As I resigned myself to the situation and was jolted by the carriage, the royal castle came into view. No one stopped the Marquis Family’s carriage; we passed through the gates and crossed the bridge without hindrance.</p>
<p id="line_469">As soon as we arrived, Barak-san headed off to the Crown Prince’s office. After seeing him off, I was guided by Chiffon-san to the harem.</p>
<p id="line_470">By the way, my current attire was, for some reason, a hand-me-down from Chiffon-san. The skirt had pants underneath, so I managed to endure it. The black fabric with gold embroidery was quite luxurious. It felt like cotton, but I could sense some magical properties in it. It seemed materials obtained from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were also used.</p>
<p id="line_471">The outfit was perfect, but no matter how I looked at it, I appeared as an adorable girl. I wanted to express my dissatisfaction, but there was a reason for the attire.</p>
<p id="line_472">One reason was to avoid being disrespectful to the royal family, but more importantly…</p>
<p id="line_473">“Because men aren’t allowed in the harem.”</p>
<p id="line_474">With that said, I had no choice but to accept it. If it was that much trouble, there was no need to meet the princess—but, to be honest, I didn’t want to meet her in the first place. My opinion, however, was completely ignored.</p>
<p id="line_475">A pleasant breeze blew through the corridor lined with columns. The first floor had walls but no doors, an architectural style unique to this region that allowed the breeze to flow freely through every room.</p>
<p id="line_476">On the way here, I noticed that while the buildings had windows, there was no glass. Unlike the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, such items seemed to be considered luxury goods here.</p>
<p id="line_477">“We have few craftsmen in our country, so not just glass but all sorts of manufacturing techniques are lagging behind. If it’s something we can import, it’s manageable, but fragile items inevitably get pushed to the back of the list,” Chiffon-san explained.</p>
<p id="line_478"><em>I see, that makes sense.</em> Discussing something I was interested in made me feel a bit more at ease. Grateful for that, I continued following Chiffon-san.</p>
<p id="line_479">After turning a few corners, I gave up on trying to remember the route. However, it wasn’t a problem. Even if I didn’t memorize the way, I had a mental map. I activated the display function and kept pace with Chiffon-san. Suddenly, a heavily guarded group approached from the end of the corridor.</p>
<p id="line_480">“Tch.”</p>
<p id="line_481">“Hm?”</p>
<p id="line_482">“O-ho-ho, it’s nothing at all. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I must apologize in advance. You might find this encounter a bit unpleasant. Please bear with it.”</p>
<p id="line_483">Trouble seemed to be brewing. I nodded and cleared my mind.</p>
<p id="line_484">Right then, a man leading the group spoke with an air of arrogance.</p>
<p id="line_485">“Well, well, if it isn’t the Marchioness. Are you here to visit Princess Zenobia?”</p>
<p id="line_486">“Yes, that’s correct, Court Physician Gustav.”</p>
<p id="line_487">The man addressed as Gustav had light purple hair slicked back and wore refined clothing. It wasn’t the Arabian-style attire popular in this country but rather a Western-style outfit with ample fabric. His attire was lavish, to say the least, and included an eye-catching pendant with a purple gemstone that looked very expensive.</p>
<p id="line_488">His skin was sickly pale, and his eyes were bloodshot. He was of average build, with sunken cheeks that gave him an unhealthy appearance. I couldn’t help but worry about the state of this country if someone like this was a doctor. Despite his sickly appearance, he leered at Chiffon-san with a grin that seemed lascivious.</p>
<p id="line_489">“Hohoho, well, well. If you have time later, I would love for you to visit my place. I could check your health while we chat.”</p>
<p id="line_490">“No, no, I couldn’t possibly trouble the Court Physician with such a thing,” Chiffon-san replied, clearly refusing. Her words were polite, but it was evident she deeply disliked this Court Physician Gustav.</p>
<p id="line_491">“Gu-fu-fu, no need to be so reserved.”</p>
<p id="line_492">“No, truly. I have a guest today, so perhaps another time.”</p>
<p id="line_493">“A guest, you say?”</p>
<p id="line_494"><em>Ah, so this is where she brings me into it.</em></p>
<p id="line_495">Feeling Gustav’s persistent gaze on me made my skin crawl. This was definitely unpleasant.</p>
<p id="line_496">“Ohhh, are you planning to introduce her as a friend to the Princess?”</p>
<p id="line_497">“I’m sorry, that’s not it at all. This person here is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, and she’s brought a very rare medicine. I asked her to come in hopes that it might benefit Princess Zenobia in some way.”</p>
<p id="line_498">“Oh?”</p>
<p id="line_499">Gustav, who had been grinning before, suddenly frowned in displeasure.</p>
<p id="line_500">“Absurd! It is because of my treatments that Princess Zenobia enjoys peace! And yet, you dare to invite some unknown charlatan here. It’s distasteful. I will report this to His Majesty and ensure that your foolishness is punished!”</p>
<p id="line_501">With that outburst, Gustav stormed off, his attendants hurriedly following after him. It was a stormy encounter. I certainly never wanted to meet him again.</p>
<p id="line_502">“Me aside, Chiffon-san, are you okay?”</p>
<p id="line_503">“I’m fine. Gustav holds a high position as Court Physician, but he lacks the rizz. In this country, martial strength is valued above all else, so no one in our Marquis family would dare defy him.”</p>
<p id="line_504">That was a relief to hear. However, that aside… Was it just my imagination?</p>
<p id="line_505">As we passed by Court Physician Gustav, I caught an extremely unpleasant smell. It was an indescribable stench, like the odor of death—something I never wanted to experience again.</p>
<p id="line_506">It not only made me feel unpleasant but also gave me a foreboding feeling.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_507">Princess Zenobia’s room was in a secluded part of the harem, adorned with a riot of colorful flowers. The room was well-ventilated and comfortable, with no direct sunlight. It seemed to be maintained in a very comfortable condition, likely thanks to the efforts of the maids standing by in the room.</p>
<p id="line_508">“Oh my, who might this be?”</p>
<p id="line_509">“I’m glad to see you’re awake. Princess Zenobia, today I have brought someone I would like you to meet.”</p>
<p id="line_510">“That voice…is it Chiffon? It’s rare for you to bring someone along.”</p>
<p id="line_511">As I observed, it became clear that Princess Zenobia was blind. Whether from birth or due to illness, her lack of sight was evident. The abundance of flowers likely served to provide her with their pleasant fragrances.</p>
<p id="line_512">As Chiffon-san and Princess Zenobia began their conversation, the maids moved efficiently and quietly. One assisted Princess Zenobia into a seated position, while another went outside to arrange refreshments.</p>
<p id="line_513">All of this happened without a word. It seemed they were thoroughly trained not to interrupt their mistress’s conversation. The maids’ coordination was impressive, but Chiffon-san gently tapped my hand, redirecting my focus to the princess.</p>
<p id="line_514">“This is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. She is the one who treated my sister and cured her illness. She is truly remarkable and I believe she can uncover the cause of your illness as well.”</p>
<p id="line_515"><em>Uh-oh</em>, this situation was turning out to be more complicated than I anticipated. Maybe I shouldn’t have taken this on so lightly, thinking I might be able to understand what was wrong.</p>
<p id="line_516">Suddenly feeling heavy and nervous, I somehow manage to get out a greeting.</p>
<p id="line_517">“I am <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as introduced. Today, I humbly ask for your permission to examine you, Princess.”</p>
<p id="line_518"><em>Was that okay?</em> I watched for the princess’s reaction with some anxiety.</p>
<p id="line_519">She responded with a light-hearted laugh. “That’s quite all right. But, I don’t like pain, so please be gentle with me.”</p>
<p id="line_520">Princess Zenobia tilted her face slightly in my direction, her lips forming a slight pout. It was an incredibly cute gesture, perfectly suited to her.</p>
<p id="line_521">As I took in her appearance, the word “fairy-like” came to mind. Not in a contrived way like Ramiris, but the genuine, storybook kind of cuteness.</p>
<p id="line_522">Her skin was pale, likely due to lack of sun exposure, and her golden hair was soft and radiant. It was such a pity that her eyes were closed. Though she was eighteen, she appeared much younger, resembling a late elementary school student. Her growth seemed stunted, likely due to being bedridden for the past three years.</p>
<p id="line_523">Her nutritional state seemed good, but—</p>
<p id="line_524">«Objection. It appears that makeup is masking the truth. The thinness of her arms and legs suggests she is consuming very little food, possibly masked by makeup.»</p>
<p id="line_525">Upon closer inspection, I realized that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was right. It was time to use <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to gather more detailed information.</p>
<p id="line_526">“Coincidentally, I also dislike pain. I used to think during every health check-up, ‘I wish they would just let me finish my treatments while I’m asleep.”’</p>
<p id="line_527">I was speaking my true feelings. In my twenties, I didn’t worry much about my health, but once I hit thirty, I became more concerned. I even had to undergo a comprehensive medical check-up, including a gastroscopy—though that’s beside the point here.</p>
<p id="line_528">Since I had received the princess’s permission, I pretended to conduct a physical examination while actually activating <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. To my surprise, no abnormalities were detected.</p>
<p id="line_529">«…Objection. Given her current state of health, these results are unnatural. The cause is unknown, so it is recommended to take a blood sample and analyze its components.»</p>
<p id="line_530">I’d never done it before, but if it was necessary…</p>
<p id="line_531">I transformed the tip of my finger into a small needle and gently pricked Princess Zenobia’s arm.</p>
<p id="line_532">“…?”</p>
<p id="line_533">For a brief moment, Princess Zenobia looked puzzled, but she didn’t seem to feel any pain. Relieved, I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to conduct the blood test.</p>
<p id="line_534">«…Report. The blood test results are in. They indicate severe malnutrition, leading to a state of extreme weakness.»</p>
<p id="line_535"><em>Hmmm</em>. Despite <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> showing no abnormalities, she was clearly in a weakened state. Was something interfering with my abilities?</p>
<p id="line_536">«Affirmative. Since the cause is unknown, symptomatic treatment is recommended. Please provide the individual with honey as medicine.»</p>
<p id="line_537"><em>I see, we have that option.</em> Apito’s honey had remarkable healing properties, capable of curing various conditions and even aiding in recovery from incurable diseases. Although the cause of her weakness was unknown, this honey should help Princess Zenobia regain her strength.</p>
<p id="line_538">“Just to confirm, you’re eating your meals properly and not being picky, right?”</p>
<p id="line_539">“How dare you speak to the princess like that?”</p>
<p id="line_540">“Even if you are a renowned doctor, you must show more respect.”</p>
<p id="line_541">My unintentional casual tone earned me a scolding from the maids. However, I received confirmation that the princess did eat three meals a day, albeit in small quantities.</p>
<p id="line_542">“Well then, I shall give you this medicine. It’s a universal remedy, so please take a spoonful after each meal. Even if you consume the entire bottle, there shouldn’t be any problems. Just make sure to take it consistently.”</p>
<p id="line_543">As I said this, I offered a small bottle of honey to the princess. Although my supply was limited, I had enough to share. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had determined that this amount would be sufficient to address any illness, so I trusted that assessment.</p>
<p id="line_544">“Oh my, what is this? I don’t like anything bitter, just so you know.”</p>
<p id="line_545">“This is actually my favorite. You can have one of your maids taste it first and give you their opinion.”</p>
<p id="line_546">“A favorite medicine?” The princess looked puzzled.</p>
<p id="line_547">One of the maids took a taste of the honey beside the princess.</p>
<p id="line_548">“—Oh my!” she exclaimed, her face lighting up with delight.</p>
<p id="line_549"><em>See? It’s delicious, isn’t it?</em> I thought, feeling a bit relieved.</p>
<p id="line_550">“Does it have to be taken only after meals?”</p>
<p id="line_551">The maid, unusually, interjected with a question.</p>
<p id="line_552">“No, you can have it as a snack on its own, or mix it into tea. It’s also yummy drizzled over cookies or cake.”</p>
<p id="line_553">“—Tone.”</p>
<p id="line_554">I couldn’t help but answer cheerfully, prompting a quiet reminder from Chiffon-san.</p>
<p id="line_555">“Ah, I mean, I believe it would be quite tasty.”</p>
<p id="line_556">I hastily corrected myself, but it seemed everyone, including the princess, pretended not to notice.</p>
<p id="line_557">Right on cue, tea was brought in. The princess added the honey to her tea and took a sip.</p>
<p id="line_558">“Oh, it’s delicious!”</p>
<p id="line_559">The princess smiled, but a dramatic change occurred immediately after.</p>
<p id="line_560">“Ah, it’s so bright…”</p>
<p id="line_561">“Princess?”</p>
<p id="line_562">“Could it be…are you able to perceive light?”</p>
<p id="line_563">The maids were in a flurry of excitement, and Chiffon-san watched the princess intently, clearly tense.</p>
<p id="line_564">Everyone’s attention was fixed on Princess Zenobia as her eyelids slowly opened, revealing her beautiful blue eyes.</p>
<p id="line_565">“I can see… I can see!”</p>
<p id="line_566">Cheers erupted, and the room was filled with jubilation.</p>
<p id="line_567">“Thank you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama… Thank you so much!”</p>
<p id="line_568">Overwhelmed with emotion, Chiffon-san and Princess Zenobia embraced each other in joy, while the maids shed tears. I watched over the heartwarming scene.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_569">And then, in the evening, I sat in the guest room assigned to me, facing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_570">A grand celebration had been hastily arranged at the Marquis Jahil House. I had tried to offer my assistance, but the servants had kindly refused with smiles.</p>
<p id="line_571">Left with nothing to do, I decided to hear <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s report.</p>
<p id="line_572">“I shall proceed with my report.”</p>
<p id="line_573">“Yeah. What was Prince Aslan like?”</p>
<p id="line_574">“Yes, I sensed an incredibly strong presence from him. If I were to fight him one-on-one, I’d say my chances are fifty-fifty.”</p>
<p id="line_575">No way! I hadn’t expected Prince Aslan to impress even someone like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> so much. To be honest, I had underestimated him. I had heard he was hailed as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the Free Guild, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s assessment that he was a Special A rank seemed accurate. In other words, he was on par with Shizu-san in strength.</p>
<p id="line_576">“Do you think <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could win?”</p>
<p id="line_577">“If there were no restrictions at all, I don’t think he would lose.”</p>
<p id="line_578">Well then, so Hell Flare would win, huh? But that would cause too much damage, so I thought it should be a last resort. In the first place, we didn’t come here to fight, so let’s try to avoid hostility as much as possible.</p>
<p id="line_579">“From your perspective, what kind of person was he?”</p>
<p id="line_580">“He seemed gallant and considerate of his comrades, leaving the impression of a fine young man with the demeanor of a ruler.”</p>
<p id="line_581">It was quite a compliment. It seemed he was someone you wouldn’t want to make an enemy of. According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, major countries and their equivalents have several Over A rank warriors. Considering that Coleus here was a martial nation entrusted with the western frontier, it was only natural that such an individual would be present.</p>
<p id="line_582">“If you’re saying that, he must be quite the opponent. In that case, supporting the Aslan faction might be the right choice. By the way, Paulo handled things well, did he?”</p>
<p id="line_583"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had gathered so much information, so he must have integrated well. That was what I was thinking when I asked, but…</p>
<p id="line_584">“Hmmm, he’s hopeless. The moment he entered the bar, he ordered alcohol and snacks and did nothing but badmouth you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_585"><em>Oh, ohh</em>. I had told him to do that, but…</p>
<p id="line_586">“Badmouthing? Not venting?”</p>
<p id="line_587">“Yes. Arrogant, rough with people, stingy—the list goes on. To be honest, I even considered taking care of him halfway through.”</p>
<p id="line_588">Hey, hey, that guy. Acting like he could do whatever he wanted when he thought no one was listening. Since he still hadn’t come back, I was a bit worried, but it seemed that concern was unnecessary.</p>
<p id="line_589">“However, thanks to that, he wasn’t suspected of anything. It seems he’s now being invited to join them as a comrade, so it doesn’t look like he’ll be coming back today.”</p>
<p id="line_590">“Well, it’s still going according to plan…”</p>
<p id="line_591">“Yes. It went according to your strategy, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, so I’ve been observing as instructed.”</p>
<p id="line_592">That was good. If things hadn’t gone well, Paulo might not have made it. For now, Paulo could be left alone.</p>
<p id="line_593">“Alright, in that case, I’ll go take care of something. I’ll leave Paulo’s surveillance to you.”</p>
<p id="line_594">“Understood.”</p>
<p id="line_595">After <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded in agreement, I closed my eyes.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_596">I snapped my eyes open—or rather, I activated Magic Sense.</p>
<p id="line_597">I was in the courtyard of the inner palace. In a corner among the plants, I had secretly concealed a Clone to avoid detection. Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I couldn’t control them simultaneously. Well, when the Clone was within my line of sight, it felt like manipulating an avatar in a game, but once it was out of range, it became impossible.</p>
<p id="line_598">So, I put my main body to sleep and woke up in the Clone.</p>
<p id="line_599">Why was I doing this? For a simple reason. I suspected Princess Zenobia was being interfered with by someone. I had healed her, but that surely wasn’t something amusing for whoever was behind this. I was certain they would set something up in return.</p>
<p id="line_600">With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in agreement, it seemed almost certain.</p>
<p id="line_601">I silently followed along the pillar, clinging to the ceiling. Checking my mental map, I headed towards Princess Zenobia’s room. There was a patrol soldier ahead. In times like these, Magic Sense, which allowed me to survey my surroundings, was incredibly useful.</p>
<p id="line_602"><em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I wonder if I’m naturally suited for spying?</em></p>
<p id="line_603">Praising myself, I arrived at my destination.</p>
<p id="line_604"><em>Oops</em>, maybe because it was the princess’s room, there was a door that hadn’t been there during the day. Did it come from above? Maybe they were using magic somehow, but it seemed they made it hard to enter easily.</p>
<p id="line_605">But even in such a situation, I didn’t panic. As an amorphous slime, I could infiltrate a room through even the smallest gap.</p>
<p id="line_606">Don’t mean to brag, but I was quite something. Maybe I was more suited to being a thief than a spy. It wasn’t exactly the most flattering method, but using my slime characteristics and skills, I felt confident I could handle any mission effortlessly.</p>
<p id="line_607">With those thoughts in mind, I found the keyhole. Silently slipping through it, I carefully observed the inside. It seemed the princess was absent. With no maids around, she must have gone for a meal or a bath.</p>
<p id="line_608">Seizing the opportunity, I slipped into the room and laid my slime body in the shadow of a potted plant in a corner.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_609">I snapped my consciousness back.</p>
<p id="line_610">I was on the bed in the assigned room. Relieved that everything had gone smoothly, I checked on my main body. I wasn’t quite used to it yet, but this skill proved to be quite handy.</p>
<p id="line_611">I got up without any issues. Glancing around, I saw Ranga sprawled out at my feet.</p>
<p id="line_612">“My lord, no suspicious individuals approached!”</p>
<p id="line_613">“Ohh, thank you for your vigilance.”</p>
<p id="line_614">I expressed my gratitude while petting Ranga. As I continued, it was time for dinner. There was no door in the room, only a curtain separating it. From beyond it, a voice called out to me.</p>
<p id="line_615">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, preparations for the banquet are complete. Please get ready soon.”</p>
<p id="line_616">It was Chiffon-san herself, who came to greet me. I concealed Ranga in the shadows and replied, “I’ll be right there.”</p>
<p id="line_617">Following her guidance, I entered the hall. Inside, nearly fifty people awaited my entrance.</p>
<p id="line_618"><em>Hey, hey, it seems I’m being treated as the guest of honor,</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p id="line_619">“Let me introduce him to you all! He is our honored guest and also the benefactor of Princess Zenobia—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono! As a skilled apothecary, I ask that you all treat him with respect.”</p>
<p id="line_620">The head of the family, Barak-san, introduced me with a commanding voice. I wasn’t just treated like a main character; I was <em>the</em> main character.</p>
<p id="line_621">The banquet began, but it wasn’t exactly enjoyable. People kept coming one after another to greet me, and I didn’t even have a moment to eat. It started with nobles related to the Marquis Jahil Family, followed by knights and wealthy merchants.</p>
<p id="line_622">I smiled politely and nodded along, but it was quite a challenging time, to say the least.</p>
<p id="line_623">As time passed, two hours went by, and it seemed like the banquet was finally coming to a close—or so I thought. The real event was about to begin.</p>
<p id="line_624">“I apologize; it must have been exhausting for you,” Chiffon-san apologized.</p>
<p id="line_625">“Well, yes, it was.”</p>
<p id="line_626">“Hahaha,” Barak-san laughed. “That’s how it goes with the nobility. Forgive us.”</p>
<p id="line_627">“No, it’s okay, really.”</p>
<p id="line_628">The Marquis and his wife, not quite acting like typical high nobility, seemed genuinely apologetic. They were concerned about me, so I assured them it was fine. After that, we moved to a quieter area to relax. There, a warm meal was prepared, and I finally had the chance to unwind.</p>
<p id="line_629">At that moment, today’s events became the topic of discussion.</p>
<p id="line_630">“Ku-ku-ku, I can just imagine the Court Physician’s frustration. Acting so freely in the court just because he’s valued by His Majesty,” Barak-san said.</p>
<p id="line_631">“He’s a cunning man. We couldn’t touch him until now, but if the princess has recovered, His Majesty might reconsider. His glory may come to an end,” Chiffon-san added.</p>
<p id="line_632">The Jahir couple seemed pleased. I didn’t sympathize much with the Court Physician since he was rather annoying. I figured it was his own fault and left it at that.</p>
<p id="line_633">As we finished discussing everything, voices from a distant place began to clamor. I thought maybe Paulo had returned, but it was something else. One of the servants hurriedly entered and reported to Barak-san.</p>
<p id="line_634">“I—I have a report! Prince Aslan has just arrived at the front entrance. He says he has something important to discuss with you. How should we proceed?”</p>
<p id="line_635">It was past midnight, quite late for a visit, and understandable if it caused some trouble. Normally, they might have turned away such a late visitor, but this was no ordinary guest—it was Prince Aslan. Moreover, he was a formidable figure with charisma, so it was a decision that the servants likely found difficult to make.</p>
<p id="line_636">Thinking it was quite a predicament, I considered it as if it were someone else’s problem.</p>
<p id="line_637">“Hmm, he’s not here for me but for you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono.”</p>
<p id="line_638">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_639">“Prince Aslan must be grateful to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama for healing the princess.”</p>
<p id="line_640">“That’s right. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have snuck into my house, which belongs to the faction opposing him.”</p>
<p id="line_641">As the couple discussed this, I found myself perplexed. Barak-san turned to me and asked, “Shall we show him in? Is that alright with you?”</p>
<p id="line_642">I didn’t think I had much choice, so I simply nodded in silence.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_643">“Sorry for the intrusion at this late hour,” Prince Aslan said as he entered.</p>
<p id="line_644">Indeed, as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had described, he was a nobleman with a commanding presence. With tan skin, short blond hair, and blue eyes, he was strikingly handsome. His taut muscles full of vitality, peeking through his partially exposed shirt, exuded an aura akin to a fierce carnivorous beast.</p>
<p id="line_645">“I don’t mind, Your Highness Aslan. It’s been a while since we talked like this, but I trust your sword arm hasn’t dulled?”</p>
<p id="line_646">“Hah! Don’t act all superior just because you once taught me a thing or two about swords!” Despite their banter, there was an oddly friendly atmosphere between them. Thinking it was just my imagination, I observed them.</p>
<p id="line_647">Prince Aslan sat down heavily, and without permission, picked up a goblet of wine. Barak-san, however, silently poured for him. It was hard to believe they were supposed adversaries, given their casual demeanor. Without showing any sign of suspicion towards poison, Prince Aslan quickly drank from his goblet, then turned toward me.</p>
<p id="line_648">“So, you’re <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Thank you for saving my sister,” he said, bowing his head—a gesture that left not just me, but even Marquis Jahil and his wife, astonished. With a wry smile at our reactions, Prince Aslan continued.</p>
<p id="line_649">“We were close, despite having different mothers. I respected my elder brother and planned to support him as Chief of Military Affairs when he became king. I honed my sword skills for that purpose, and days spent fighting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were no hardship. But then—“ His tone turned mournful as he spoke of his brother, Crown Prince Sauzer.</p>
<p id="line_650">“At first, when Zenobia fell ill, both my brother and I thought it was just a cold. But it wasn’t. Her waking hours grew shorter, and eventually, she lost her sight. I was desperate, but they said nothing more could be done…”</p>
<p id="line_651">It was Court Physician Gustav, serving as the royal doctor, who had said so. He indicated that this was a problem beyond the reach of force, and that Prince Aslan had no choice but to resign himself to it.</p>
<p id="line_652">“If this were truly an illness, one could consider it fate,” Prince Aslan continued. “Or could it be something else?” Barak-san asked, to which Prince Aslan nodded vigorously.</p>
<p id="line_653">“Barak, have you had the opportunity to meet His Majesty lately?”</p>
<p id="line_654">“No, I haven’t.”</p>
<p id="line_655">“Doesn’t that seem suspicious to you?”</p>
<p id="line_656">“What do you mean—no, now that you mention it…why haven’t I?”</p>
<p id="line_657">Barak-san’s demeanor changed as he realized the oddity of the situation. “If His Majesty is seriously ill, only Court Physician Gustav would be allowed to meet with him…”</p>
<p id="line_658">“That’s right. I’ve been requesting an audience for years, but it hasn’t been granted. Can you believe it? Me, the son of the second queen, unable to meet with my father the king!”</p>
<p id="line_659">“Hm, Hmmm…”</p>
<p id="line_660">Even though I had just heard about this, it felt very unnatural. The fact that no one had questioned it suggested that everyone had been influenced by some form of interference, almost akin to ‘brainwashing.’</p>
<p id="line_661">“And the fact that you, the high-ranking nobles, haven’t found it strange proves the dire state of this country!” Prince Aslan declared, leaving Barak-san unable to refute his words.</p>
<p id="line_662"><em>But if that’s the case, then why…?</em></p>
<p id="line_663">“Are you wondering why I haven’t revealed this until now?” Prince Aslan asked. “It’s simple. Not only Zenobia, but even my beloved elder brother has fallen into Gustav’s hands.”</p>
<p id="line_664">“What?! Such a statement cannot be ignored, even if it comes from Your Highness.”</p>
<p id="line_665">“Do you think Crown Prince Sauzer is the mastermind, Prince Aslan?”</p>
<p id="line_666">Prince Aslan responded resolutely to the worried Jahir couple. “Think about it. My sickly elder brother Sauzer suddenly became healthy and gained power three years ago. It can’t be unrelated, can it?”</p>
<p id="line_667">No one could argue against that.</p>
<p id="line_668">“So, Prince Aslan, you believe that Crown Prince Sauzer is behind Princess Zenobia’s illness?” Chiffon-san voiced, pondering the situation.</p>
<p id="line_669">The timing was certainly suspicious—Princess Zenobia fell ill three years ago, just as Crown Prince Sauzer suddenly became healthy and gained power. It was almost eerie that no one had questioned it until now.</p>
<p id="line_670">“Don’t be ashamed. You were made to think that way by my brother’s Charm.”</p>
<p id="line_671">“Charm?”</p>
<p id="line_672">“Could it be…!”</p>
<p id="line_673">“Exactly. It’s a specialty of the vampires. I have an associate from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and I’ve been consulting with them. They told me about the characteristics of vampires, and our situation fits perfectly, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_674">“Hold on, Your Highness. That doesn’t add up. Crown Prince Sauzer was undoubtedly human, and even if he was turned into a subordinate of the vampires, he operates in broad daylight without any issues.”</p>
<p id="line_675">“Yes, that puzzled me too. So I inquired further and learned that the higher ranks of the vampire species can indeed withstand sunlight.”</p>
<p id="line_676">“No way…” Chiffon-san was speechless. However, Barak-san still seemed unconvinced.</p>
<p id="line_677">“So, Your Highness suspects that Court Physician Gustav is a vampire, manipulating Crown Prince Sauzer as his subordinate?”</p>
<p id="line_678">“That is one possibility. But I suspect something else. I believe that Sauzer might have been injected with Origin Blood, transforming him into a high-ranking pseudo-vampire.”</p>
<p id="line_679">“Origin Blood?” I couldn’t help but ask. Prince Aslan glanced at me briefly before answering without much concern.</p>
<p id="line_680">“Yes. My old friend Karl suspects that this isn’t merely a power struggle for the throne of a single kingdom but a sabotage operation orchestrated by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Valentin against humanity’s defenses.”</p>
<p id="line_681">The room fell silent. I, too, was momentarily speechless. What was supposed to be a simple task of deciding which prince’s faction to support had suddenly escalated into a grand tale involving a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. At this point, there was no backing out. Supporting Paulo was no longer the issue—the risks had far outstripped any potential reward.</p>
<p id="line_682">I didn’t want to deal with a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; it was a matter of life and death. But given that I couldn’t escape, I needed to think carefully about my next steps. As I was lost in these gloomy thoughts…</p>
<p id="line_683">“Hrmmph!” Barak-san suddenly stood up and shouted, his face twisted in a mix of shock and realization.</p>
<p id="line_684">“No way… Even I have been Charmed…”</p>
<p id="line_685">“Oh, Violent Break, huh? Impressive. Your skills haven’t waned.”</p>
<p id="line_686">So it turned out to be some kind of technique?</p>
<p id="line_687">«Affirmative. It appears to be an art that circulates Battlewill throughout the body to detect and expel foreign elements.»</p>
<p id="line_688">Now that it had been mentioned, I noticed that Barak-san’s Battlewill had filled his body, making him seem larger. This technique was likely used in combat, but this time, its purpose was to resist the Charm affecting him.</p>
<p id="line_689">“What are you saying? As you mentioned, it appears I’ve been under a Charm, Prince Aslan. I beg your forgiveness for falling so easily into the hands of a demonic being.” Barak-san knelt before Prince Aslan, offering an apology. By breaking the Charm with his own strength, he had decided to fully trust Prince Aslan.</p>
<p id="line_690">“My dear…” Chiffon-san began.</p>
<p id="line_691">“Chiffon, take my hand.” Barak-san instructed. As she complied, his Battlewill surged into her, dispelling any lingering malevolent influence.</p>
<p id="line_692">“Hmm, it seems you weren’t as deeply affected since you spent less time in close contact with Crown Prince Sauzer. It’s fortunate we noticed it at this point,” Barak-san observed.</p>
<p id="line_693">“I see. The Charm must have prevented us from speaking out until now,” Chiffon-san realized.</p>
<p id="line_694">“Hmph, exactly! Because of that, baseless suspicions arose about me attempting to usurp the throne. Though I appreciate that you still trusted me,” Prince Aslan replied.</p>
<p id="line_695">“If only you had confided in us sooner…” Barak-san lamented.</p>
<p id="line_696">“Fool! Things have worked out now, but that’s only in hindsight. I couldn’t reveal anything until I had gathered enough evidence to convince your suspicious minds.”</p>
<p id="line_697">“My apologies. So, you do have definitive proof, then?”</p>
<p id="line_698">“There is indeed. Karl has captured the black market merchant who sold the Origin Blood to Gustav. With his testimony, our legitimacy will be proven beyond doubt.”</p>
<p id="line_699">“Oooh!”</p>
<p id="line_700">I felt like I had been left behind in the conversation, but it seemed the problem was on the verge of being resolved. Initially, I was worried we’d have to confront <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Valentin, but it looked like the situation could be addressed by arresting Court Physician Gustav.</p>
<p id="line_701">Now that Prince Aslan and Barak-san had joined forces, the power of Sauzer’s faction was significantly weakened. If it was revealed that Sauzer was actually a vampire, the Aslan faction’s victory seemed inevitable.</p>
<p id="line_702">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, I must thank you again for saving my sister. With your medicine, Zenobia will not have to become a vampire,” Prince Aslan said gratefully.</p>
<p id="line_703">“Indeed. Today, the princess enjoyed a stroll in the garden for the first time in a long while. Though she still cannot walk on her own, she was delightfully admiring the flowers under the sunlight,” Chiffon-san replied.</p>
<p id="line_704">“I know. Hearing that brought me immense joy!” Prince Aslan responded, clearly moved.</p>
<p id="line_705">“Hmm, it appears the princess has only been weakened and not turned into a vampire. Since Crown Prince Sauzer deeply cherishes her, it’s possible he’s protecting her with his last shreds of reason,” Barak-san mused.</p>
<p id="line_706">“I want to believe that too,” Prince Aslan agreed. “Anyway, our priority should be to deal with the traitor Gustav. Since Origin Blood seems to be a curse, if we can somehow handle the mastermind, we might be able to rescue my brother.”</p>
<p id="line_707">“I, Barak, would like to offer my humble assistance,” Barak-san offered.</p>
<p id="line_708">“I’m counting on it,” Prince Aslan replied.</p>
<p id="line_709">With that, everything seemed neatly settled. Though I played a minor role, I was now fully committed to aiding in the mission to save Princess Zenobia.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" id="story-7" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/title_cards/story-7.png"/></div>
<p class="pagebreak" id="line_710"></p>
<h1 class="ch-number">Story 7</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Coleus’s Dream Part 3</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_711">The operation was set to take place in three days. My role was to stabilize Princess Zenobia’s condition and aim for her complete recovery. With that in mind, despite the late hour, I transferred my consciousness to the Clone I had hidden in Princess Zenobia’s bedroom.</p>
<p id="line_712">At that moment, I froze. Inside her room was a presence exuding an overwhelming aura. My Magic Sense detected a spine-chilling dread. <em>Could this be what you call fear?</em></p>
<p id="line_713">«Objection. You are reacting to an overwhelming amount of magicules. It is weaker than Charybdis but comparable to the Orc Disaster. Given their stable <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it might be best to avoid fighting them alone.»</p>
<p id="line_714">Seriously…? If even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said this, there was no doubt this was an extremely dangerous opponent. Prince Aslan seemed strong, but this one was far beyond comparison. In fact, this might be a high-ranking vampire. Could I win if I fought this guy seriously? Since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> advised against fighting alone, it had to be dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_715">At the very least, I needed to gauge their strength—</p>
<p id="line_716">«…Report. If you attempt <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in this situation, there is an 80 percent or greater chance your presence will be detected. Do you wish to proceed? YES/NO»</p>
<p id="line_717"><em>Of course, it’s NO. You didn’t need to ask me that</em>. Holding my breath, I decided to watch how things unfolded. I cleared my mind and tried to make my presence as inconspicuous as possible, focusing on the conversation I could hear.</p>
<p id="line_718">“Ah, Zenobia. I’ll say this again, but I’m truly glad you woke up. Even though Aslan was tormenting you, there was nothing I could do. Please forgive your useless brother.”</p>
<p id="line_719">“No, dear brother. You did nothing wrong. Also, it hasn’t even been confirmed that it was dear brother Aslan’s fault—”</p>
<p id="line_720">“No! It’s certain that he’s the culprit. Gustav said the same. He manipulated the guild to prevent our country from receiving rare medicine. If it weren’t for Marquis Jahil’s guest who happened to have a special medicine, you would have remained bedridden.”</p>
<p id="line_721">“But…”</p>
<p id="line_722">“There’s nothing to worry about now, so rest well today.”</p>
<p id="line_723">“All right. I apologize for causing you concern.”</p>
<p id="line_724">“Of course not. For my adorable sister, it’s nothing to spare some of my time.”</p>
<p id="line_725">Crown Prince Sauzer spoke to Princess Zenobia in a very gentle voice. It felt different from what I had imagined and was completely different from what I had heard. As I tried to make sense of the situation, I sensed Crown Prince Sauzer leaving the room.</p>
<p id="line_726">The moment he stepped into the hallway, his presence changed. The stable <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> turned aggressive, and he began to exude an overwhelming aura. It seemed that Crown Prince Sauzer was genuinely concerned about his sister. That was why he suppressed his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to avoid harming her.</p>
<p id="line_727">This meant Prince Aslan’s statements were incorrect. Was he genuinely mistaken, or was he trying to deceive us…? Sensing the presence moving away, I decided to stay still a bit longer, just to be cautious. Then, at the very edge of my hearing range, I heard Crown Prince Sauzer speaking with someone.</p>
<p id="line_728">“—It’s good that she got healed while Father is still alive. Now that Zenobia has recovered, there’s no need to hold back. Eradicate Aslan and those who support him.”</p>
<p id="line_729">It was a very cold voice. One might think it was someone else who had spoken to Princess Zenobia, for the voice carried a chilling tone that would make any listener shudder. I realized that this was Crown Prince Sauzer’s true nature.</p>
<p id="line_730">Honestly, I was at a loss. Aslan’s faction was scheduled to rise to action in three days. In response, Sauzer’s faction had begun to move to crush Aslan’s faction. Civil war—a full-scale war, at that, huh? This was a problem far beyond what an ordinary adventurer could handle.</p>
<p id="line_731">As I pondered what to do, I let out a deep sigh.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_732">In any case, Princess Zenobia was safe. However, it was still too early to let our guard down. The prediction that someone would interfere wasn’t just my suspicion; it was also a consensus with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If Crown Prince Sauzer wasn’t the culprit, then who could possibly be behind this? The thought of someone weakening Princess Zenobia right under the nose of such a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like Sauzer made me uneasy about how powerful this person must be.</p>
<p id="line_733">Could Prince Aslan really be the culprit, as Crown Prince Sauzer claimed? No, I didn’t think that was the case. What was the objective in the first place? I had read detective novels; in such cases, the person who benefitted from causing the princes to fight was often the culprit. Yes, in that case—</p>
<p id="line_734">“Who is there?”</p>
<p id="line_735"><em>Gasp!</em> I got so absorbed in figuring out the culprit that I let my guard down. The potted plant blocked her view, so Princess Zenobia couldn’t see me. I thought I was completely hidden, but I had been easily found out.</p>
<p id="line_736">“Ah, are you the one who came during the day? Was it <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama—”</p>
<p id="line_737">“You’re mistaken.”</p>
<p id="line_738">Dangerous! How did she identify me even though I was in slime form?! I must absolutely not admit it. If I did, my social standing would plummet. “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, I heard you snuck into the princess’s room at night.” Imagine if I heard that! I wouldn’t know how to face my companions after that.</p>
<p id="line_739">“Oh, so I was mistaken. Then, may I know your name?”</p>
<p id="line_740">“Uh, uhmm, it’s Satoru…”</p>
<p id="line_741">“I see, so you are Satoru-san.”</p>
<p id="line_742">“Y-yes.”</p>
<p id="line_743">This was bad. I was in unprecedented danger. If she asked why I was in her room, I was done for. In my desperation, I decided to show Princess Zenobia my current form. I thought that by showing my adorable slime form, she would believe that I was not the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from earlier.</p>
<p id="line_744">“Oh my! That form is cute too.” Princess Zenobia smiled warmly. Even though I appeared as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I had worried for nothing. She didn’t seem scared of me at all. What concerned me more was her words, ‘that form too.’</p>
<p id="line_745">“Uh, I am a slime, and I have nothing to do with that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san…”</p>
<p id="line_746">“Hehe, you seem like a very kind mister. Let’s leave it at that, so would you listen to my request?” Princess Zenobia said.</p>
<p id="line_747">I didn’t understand why she called me ‘mister,’ but it seemed she was willing to go along with it. Relieved, I decided to listen to what she had to say.</p>
<p id="line_748">“I have lost my sight, but in exchange, I can now see the shape of people’s ‘souls.’ My elder brothers, Sauzer and Aslan, appear as wailing boys. They are very kind people, deeply saddened by my condition.”</p>
<p id="line_749">This was unexpected. If that was true, then neither of them seemed to be the culprit.</p>
<p id="line_750">“Compared to them, Court Physician Gustav is a frightening person. I cannot see his true nature. It’s very murky, like a pale purple darkness…”</p>
<p id="line_751"><em>That almost sounds like you’re saying he’s the culprit!</em></p>
<p id="line_752">“If that’s the case, then you should—”</p>
<p id="line_753">“I cannot tell them. If I speak up, my brothers will be in danger.”</p>
<p id="line_754">“That’s…”</p>
<p id="line_755">“And there’s something I’m very concerned about.”</p>
<p id="line_756">“And what is it?”</p>
<p id="line_757">“My father, the king, has not visited me once since I fell ill. He has always only been interested in himself. Court Physician Gustav is his confidant. I just cannot believe that he has nothing to do with it,” Princess Zenobia explained.</p>
<p id="line_758">Her ability was called the unique skill Wisher. It seemed to be a power to see the shape of people’s ‘soul’—a.k.a. their true nature. Both the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from the day and the slime Satoru now were me, but Princess Zenobia saw right through it. She might have called me ‘mister’ because she could see my past life. If that was the case, then her power was real.</p>
<p id="line_759">Since it was enough for me to believe that her power was genuine, it was undeniable that Gustav was filled with malice. He was likely the culprit, and there was a good chance he was feeding lies to Crown Prince Sauzer. But the motive was weak. Even if he pitted the two princes against each other, it wouldn’t benefit Gustav.</p>
<p id="line_760">However, what if…he was acting under the king’s orders?</p>
<p id="line_761">“So you believe that Court Physician Gustav is acting under the orders of the king, your father?”</p>
<p id="line_762">“Yes, that is correct. That’s why it’s dangerous for me to inform Brother Sauzer. It could endanger his life.”</p>
<p id="line_763"><em>I see.</em> I understood Princess Zenobia’s concerns. However, I found it hard to believe that such a powerful crown prince could be easily defeated.</p>
<p id="line_764">“But he seems very stro—”</p>
<p id="line_765">“…! Hide! And suppress your presence!” Princess Zenobia shouted, cutting off my words.</p>
<p id="line_766">Instead of asking why, I decided to follow her command. That was the right decision. Just after I hid behind the potted plant, someone entered the room.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_767">The person who entered the room was Gustav. He seemed to think Princess Zenobia hadn’t noticed him and cast a spell toward her bed.</p>
<p id="line_768">«Report. It is Illusion Magic: Sleep Down. The effect only makes the target fall asleep, so it can be deduced that there is no intent to kill.»</p>
<p id="line_769">I almost jumped out, but hearing that reassured me. Princess Zenobia seemed to have expected this, so I decided to observe a bit longer.</p>
<p id="line_770">“Gu-fu-fu, sleeping well, aren’t you? For you to escape my spell, that must have been a very vexing wonder drug. It would be too early for you to recover. For the great one’s sake, I must further refine your ‘soul.’ But this can be used to our advantage.”</p>
<p id="line_771">As he muttered, Gustav raised his hand over Princess Zenobia. From his palm, a repulsive miasma was released, and in an instant, it began to afflict Princess Zenobia. Seeing this, I almost leaped out, but—</p>
<p id="line_772">‹Don’t!›</p>
<p id="line_773">I felt a strong thought and stopped.</p>
<p id="line_774">“Hmm? Did I hear something…? No, it must have been nothing.”</p>
<p id="line_775">That was close. If she had spoken up even a little later, Gustav would have noticed. Moreover, this Gustav didn’t seem to be a mere lowlife but appeared much stronger than I initially thought. I realized I had underestimated him.</p>
<p id="line_776">‹Indeed. My elder brother was weak, but he became strong after receiving treatment from Court Physician Gustav. His current strength is likely due to—›</p>
<p id="line_777">Due to what Gustav gave him, perhaps. <em>I see</em>. Prince Aslan also suspected that Crown Prince Sauzer might have become one of Gustav’s minions. He didn’t seem like a vampire, but he was likely in a state close to being a puppet.</p>
<p id="line_778">‹So, I want you to save my brothers.›</p>
<p id="line_779">That was an unreasonable request. I thought of refusing, saying it wasn’t my concern—but then I saw it. A crying girl. A girl who used to play happily with two boys, now fallen ill, watching her brothers quarrel, suffering in despair. I didn’t like things like that. If I didn’t know, I could have ignored it, but now that I knew—I had to do it.</p>
<p id="line_780">So, I told her.</p>
<p id="line_781">‹I can’t, after all.›</p>
<p id="line_782">‹I understand—›</p>
<p id="line_783">‹If I’m going to save them, it has to be everyone, including you.›</p>
<p id="line_784">‹Oh my!›</p>
<p id="line_785">I wanted to tell her not to mess around and leave herself out of the count. It was too early to give up. We must aim for the best and fight back. Do everything we can. Keep trying until the end. If we failed, we could laugh it off then. But still—I wanted to turn the tears of a despairing, crying girl into tears of joy.</p>
<p id="line_786">‹I promise to do everything in my power.›</p>
<p id="line_787">‹You are indeed a kind mister.›</p>
<p id="line_788">I thought about apologizing if I failed, but that would be lame, so I didn’t say it out loud.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_789">After that, Gustav left with a sly grin. He muttered, “I will summon that little girl too and sacrifice her,” so it seemed he was targeting me as well. It was frustrating, but I had to be patient. If I fought him now, I might win or I might lose. Such a gamble was out of the question. I shouldn’t act on my emotions but rather devise a strategy to win. That was my way.</p>
<p id="line_790">I bid farewell to Princess Zenobia and shifted my consciousness to devise a plan. As soon as I opened my eyes, I called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ranga.</p>
<p id="line_791">“I am here.”</p>
<p id="line_792">“My lord, is there something you need?”</p>
<p id="line_793">“Yeah. But I’ll explain later. I’m going to meet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> now, so you two come with me.”</p>
<p id="line_794">“Understood.”</p>
<p id="line_795">“Of course, my lord!”</p>
<p id="line_796">Naturally, I left a Clone to sleep in my bed. This way, I could handle any nighttime visitors. Even though it was midnight, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ranga accompanied me without complaint. Grateful for that, I activated the elemental magic: Warp Portal to transport us to my room in Tempest. From there, we headed straight to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s private quarters.</p>
<p id="line_797"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was awake, waiting for me. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must have informed him in advance, as he was ready to listen without any need for explanation.</p>
<p id="line_798">“So, what’s the situation?” He asked, so I explained the current situation. Then, I shared my deduction.</p>
<p id="line_799">“So, Crown Prince Sauzer is a puppet of that guy Gustav, yet he’s as strong as an average <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And his younger brother, Prince Aslan, is trying to overthrow him, right?”</p>
<p id="line_800">“Well, summarizing it like that, yeah. He seems to believe Crown Prince Sauzer is a vampire, and he’s probably being fed false evidence by Sauzer’s people. So, if he rises up now based on these mistaken justifications, it’ll constitute treason.”</p>
<p id="line_801">“I see, it’s a complete setup. But what does Gustav gain by causing conflict between the two princes?”</p>
<p id="line_802">“I don’t know. Princess Zenobia thinks it might be the king’s orders…but honestly, it’s unclear. Well, dwelling on things we don’t know won’t help. We should just be cautious because it seems suspicious. What matters is stopping the conflict between the princes.”</p>
<p id="line_803">That was right. If we could resolve the dispute between the two princes, we could then expose Gustav’s misdeeds. Then we would naturally get to the mastermind behind all this.</p>
<p id="line_804">“Indeed, that seems like the quickest way.”</p>
<p id="line_805">“If we have time, I can investigate the hidden circumstances…”</p>
<p id="line_806">“No, we don’t have time. They’re supposed to take action in three days, and before that, our enemy’s strength has proven to be beyond our expectations. Even with you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it’s dangerous to act alone.”</p>
<p id="line_807">“Regretful. I will continue to strive for improvement.”</p>
<p id="line_808"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked frustrated, but he’d have to endure this. If I weighed pride against safety, my policy was to choose safety.</p>
<p id="line_809">“So, when will we set out?”</p>
<p id="line_810"><em>Let’s see…</em></p>
<p id="line_811">«Report. It is predicted there will be movement by tomorrow.»</p>
<p id="line_812"><em>Tomorrow? Will things really happen that quickly?</em></p>
<p id="line_813">«Affirmative. Individual: Gustav placed a ‘curse’ on Princess Zenobia. This will shift the blame for her deteriorating health onto—»</p>
<p id="line_814"><em>So he’s going to pin it on me…</em></p>
<p id="line_815">«Affirmative. Afterward, the individual will likely fabricate an issue, holding the Marquis Jahil family responsible for bringing in the criminal—»</p>
<p id="line_816">In response to that, Aslan’s faction would act<em>… I see.</em> Since Sauzer’s faction was fully prepared, there was no need to wait for Aslan’s faction to gather strength. They’d use me and the Marquis’s family as bait to lure out Prince Aslan and capture him all at once.</p>
<p id="line_817"><em>I’ll definitely stop that.</em></p>
<p id="line_818">“It’s tomorrow. I’m deliberately jumping into the lion’s den, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’ll rely on you to stall Prince Aslan.”</p>
<p id="line_819">“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p id="line_820">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’ll leave Barak-san to you. Try to persuade him, but if that fails, hold him back by force.”</p>
<p id="line_821">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_822">“My lord, what shall I do?”</p>
<p id="line_823">“As for you, Ranga…” Taking him onto the battlefield would attract too much attention. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could disguise themselves somewhat, but it would be difficult for Ranga. It wouldn’t be good if there were any suspicions about our connection.</p>
<p id="line_824">“I entrust the defense of the Marquis Jahil’s household to you. Ensure the safety of his wife and household members!”</p>
<p id="line_825">“Understood! Leave it to me!”</p>
<p id="line_826">It was good that Ranga had a role to play. The safety of Jeff-sensei’s sister was crucial, so I’d count on him to do his best.</p>
<p id="line_827">“So, what about you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_828">“Me? I have a little something to take care of.”</p>
<p id="line_829">I said with a fearless smile. Then, I shared my thoughts with everyone and began preparing for tomorrow.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_830">On the roof of the heavily guarded royal castle, the girl sat. Clad in dark-colored attire, she blended seamlessly into the night sky, remaining unnoticed by anyone. She exuded an air of dignity, yet her expression was clouded with discontent.</p>
<p id="line_831">“What’s happening? I merely came to observe the situation, yet why is that person now caught up in this incident?” A complaint slipped from the girl’s delicate lips, expressing her irritation.</p>
<p id="line_832">She had heard various stories from an acquaintance, but nothing had hinted at this incident. Driven by curiosity, she had followed the one who piqued her interest to this distant location. Now, it seemed that decision was proving to be a mistake.</p>
<p id="line_833">To intervene or not—that was the dilemma. Even making that choice felt uncertain.</p>
<p id="line_834">“This is troublesome. Ignoring it might be the best course of action to avoid further complications, but the fact that things have escalated to this point could also hold the key. It’s perplexing. At this rate, I can’t afford to act rashly…”</p>
<p id="line_835">In hindsight, she thought she should have asked for more details before coming here. Yet, she knew that request would have been impossible. It was futile to dwell on what-ifs. Shaking her head, she dismissed the thought and focused on the present.</p>
<p id="line_836">“Well, let’s just observe for now. However, it seems there is someone trying to pin crimes on us as well. Depending on the situation, I may need to take action against him.”</p>
<p id="line_837">With that conclusion, the girl smirked arrogantly and let out a chuckle.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_838">The next morning, a messenger from the royal castle arrived at my doorstep, demanding my arrest. It was all according to plan, so I complied without protest.</p>
<p id="line_839">“Because of the suspicious medicine you brought, Her Highness has remained asleep without waking up! Distressing! Oh, how distressing! How do you intend to take responsibility for this?!” Gustav exclaimed, putting on a melodramatic performance, but it was all within expectations, so I didn’t feel angry.</p>
<p id="line_840">I lied. It was quite infuriating, but this too was part of the plan. I allowed myself to be led to a cell in silence. The reason was simple: I needed an alibi. By letting myself be arrested, I ensured that there would be witnesses who could testify that I was locked away during the critical moments.</p>
<p id="line_841">In reality, it wasn’t me who was in the cell—it was one of my Clones. Since I couldn’t switch my consciousness smoothly, I planned to switch places as soon as I received the signal, allowing me, as a head of state, to avoid direct culpability for what was about to unfold. Once Gustav was dealt with, proving my innocence would be straightforward.</p>
<p id="line_842">This was the plan devised by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and I was fully on board with it.</p>
<p id="line_843">I waited for about an hour in that cell. Then, finally, the signal came.</p>
<p id="line_844">‹There has been movement. We will now begin our operation.› <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s voice echoed in my mind.</p>
<p id="line_845">Just as I anticipated, Prince Aslan and Barak had already joined forces and begun rallying their allies. Upon hearing of my capture, Barak-san acted swiftly. Since they’d moved up the schedule by three days, it was impossible to gather everyone. Still, they were willing to take action because of my prior effort to save Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_846">Prince Aslan would have heard about Princess Zenobia’s collapse by now. He knew Gustav was behind it and would be looking to rescue me before Gustav could dispose of me. Everything was progressing as expected, making me smile to myself.</p>
<p id="line_847">‹I’ll move now as well. Are you and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> okay on your own?› I asked.</p>
<p id="line_848">‹No need to worry. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I shall buy time until you arrive, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.› <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> replied confidently.</p>
<p id="line_849">‹Exactly as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> says.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_852">With that said, I sprang into action.</p>
<p id="line_853">I snapped my consciousness back to the Clone left in Princess Zenobia’s room and woke up.</p>
<p id="line_854">‹Oh my! You’ve really come?›</p>
<p id="line_855">‹Of course. I promised, didn’t I?›</p>
<p id="line_856">After mentally replying, I quickly assessed the room. The maids were present, but there was no sign of Crown Prince Sauzer or Gustav. Satisfied that the coast was clear, I quickly changed my appearance.</p>
<p id="line_857">My usual look was too risky, so I reverted my height to that of my previous life. The ‘magic body’ crafted with magicules might have made my reactions a bit slower, but it offered more defense—so I couldn’t complain. I kept my hair color the same but tied it into a flowing ponytail. My eyes remained golden, and while this transformation wasn’t drastic, it would have to be enough.</p>
<p id="line_858">My outfit took inspiration from Arabian Nights. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had whipped up a batch of disguises overnight, and I had borrowed this one while deciding on disguises for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_859">Naturally, the sudden appearance of a stranger in the room threw the maids into a panic.</p>
<p id="line_860">“Wha, a suspicious person!”</p>
<p id="line_861">“Could it be an assassin targeting the princess?!”</p>
<p id="line_862">True to their status as top-tier maids, they seemed trained in combat and attempted to block my path.</p>
<p id="line_863">But they were too slow.</p>
<p id="line_864">“Demonwire Bind!”</p>
<p id="line_865">“ “ “Ah!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_866">Using Sticky Steel Thread, I immobilized the maids in an instant.</p>
<p id="line_867">“Now, I’ll be taking the princess into my care,” I declared, picking up the sleeping Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_868">“W-wait!”</p>
<p id="line_869">“Disrespectful! Who are you?!”</p>
<p id="line_870">“There’s no thief who waits when told to wait, just as there’s no suspicious person who answers when asked who they are. But I’ll be kind enough to tell you. I am the Great Phantom Thief Ri—Satoru!”</p>
<p id="line_871">“Ri-Satoru?”</p>
<p id="line_872">“No. It’s Satoru. The Great Phantom Thief Satoru, that is. Do well to remember that!”</p>
<p id="line_873">That was close. I almost blurted out “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” but it seemed I was more used to the name <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> than my real name, Satoru. Even I was caught off guard by that. I’d need to be more careful going forward.</p>
<p id="line_874">With my declaration made, I put my foot onto the windowsill and jumped out. There was no glass, so getting out was easy even with my hands full.</p>
<p id="line_875">‹Um…why did you say ‘Great Phantom Thief’?›</p>
<p id="line_876"><em>Uh, well, you see…</em></p>
<p id="line_877">‹—It just popped into my head.›</p>
<p id="line_878">I recalled something random from my childhood and blurted it out… In hindsight, it might have been a mistake.</p>
<p id="line_879">No, this should be fine.</p>
<p id="line_880">‹Ah, I see. But, wouldn’t it have been better not to say anything?›</p>
<p id="line_881">It was an innocent question, but it still stung a little. I really should avoid unnecessary theatrics from now on.</p>
<p id="line_882">‹Ha-hahaha, no that’s not it. It was all misinformation to confuse them!›</p>
<p id="line_883">I bluffed my way out of that one.</p>
<p id="line_884">Then, spreading my wings, I soared into the vast sky.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>

<p id="line_886">Before long, a carriage from the Jahil family stopped in front of the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p id="line_887">“Just as expected.”</p>
<p id="line_888">“Of course. When it comes to situations like this, I don’t feel like the General would make a mistake.”</p>
<p id="line_889">“Agreed.”</p>
<p id="line_890"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded in agreement. The “General” referred to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. To avoid accidentally mentioning his name, it was decided to use this term during the operation.</p>
<p id="line_891">They continued their surveillance, and soon people began to gather one after another.</p>
<p id="line_892">“Everything’s proceeding as planned. I’ll report to the General.”</p>
<p id="line_893">“Ah, I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p id="line_894">With that, the operation commenced. Nearly thirty tough guys had gathered in the plaza in front of the guild. Every one of them was at least Rank B or higher, an impressive lineup.</p>
<p id="line_895">Aslan’s faction disliked having weaker members who could become liabilities and increase casualties. They intended to storm the royal castle with only their elite forces to achieve their goal. Their objective was to rescue the captured <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and use that momentum to also rescue Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_896">However, just as they were about to take action, they were obstructed by two men. It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, dressed in Arabian Nights-style attire. Both had turbans wrapped around their heads, hiding their distinctive features. It looked somewhat out of place, but adventurers tended to have unique styles, so no one paid it much mind.</p>
<p id="line_897">More importantly…</p>
<p id="line_898">“What’s your problem, huh?”</p>
<p id="line_899">“Hey, are you seriously trying to interfere? You’ll regret underestimating us, ya know?”</p>
<p id="line_900">Many of them were more adept at communicating with their fists than with words. Although being a high-ranking individual came with a certain level of status, there were still many who were driven by the instinct to assert dominance through strength.</p>
<p id="line_901"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had anticipated this. They planned to sacrifice a few to get their message across.</p>
<p id="line_902">Among them, Paulo was the first to act. As a newcomer, he wanted to demonstrate his strength here. But that was a mistake.</p>
<p id="line_903"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hadn’t forgotten Paulo’s complaints about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That was why he wasn’t going to miss this chance.</p>
<p id="line_904">“Heheh, dunno who you are, but I, Paulo—known as the Bare Fist, now the Staff Commander—will take you on. If you value your life, you’ll keep quiet—Pugyah, Gyagyagyah!”</p>
<p id="line_905">Paulo was sent flying. In one strike, no—three additional strikes in a flowing manner. In an instant, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> landed a total of four strikes.</p>
<p id="line_906">“I’m Mineuchi.”</p>
<p id="line_907">“Mineuchi, you didn’t hold back there. Isn’t that a bit much?”</p>
<p id="line_908">“This guy was badmouthing the General. He deserved a little punishment.”</p>
<p id="line_909">“I see, then I have no complaints.”</p>
<p id="line_910">Watching Paulo go down, the adventurers around them bristled with hostility. Despite that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> casually conversed, their attitude enough to provoke the adventurers further.</p>
<p id="line_911">“Ya have some nerve!”</p>
<p id="line_912">“Heyyy! Just because you took down Paulo, don’t get cocky!”</p>
<p id="line_913">Emotions exploded, instinct driving them to eliminate their enemies. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> welcomed this response.</p>
<p id="line_914">And so, the brawl began—but it didn’t last long.</p>
<p id="line_915">“Stop it, all of you.”</p>
<p id="line_916">“You can’t win against them. Instead of useless sacrifices, we should be the ones dealing with them.”</p>
<p id="line_917">Prince Aslan and Marquis Barak, growing impatient, confronted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_918">In situations like this, when facing formidable opponents, it was common to weaken them with weaker fighters before the stronger ones stepped in. However, there was also the reverse pattern: if confident in their abilities, the leaders might step forward themselves to aim directly for victory.</p>
<p id="line_919">Normally, as royal nobles, Aslan and Barak wouldn’t be at the forefront. But given the imminent battle with Sauzer’s faction, they decided that confronting the situation directly for a quick resolution was the best course of action.</p>
<p id="line_920"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Aslan faced each other, exchanging challenging glances. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smirked confidently and provoked:</p>
<p id="line_921">“Hmph, so you finally show yourselves. Just the kind of opponents worthy of my attention.”</p>
<p id="line_922">“Preposterous. Whether you’re assassins hired by the traitor Gustav or not, if you’re here to interfere, we won’t hold back.”</p>
<p id="line_923">“We’re not assassins, but we will be in your way.”</p>
<p id="line_924">“I have other business to attend to after this. Sorry, but I don’t have time to play with you!”</p>
<p id="line_925"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Aslan exchanged their opening remarks and drew their swords simultaneously. And so, a fierce sword fight began.</p>
<p id="line_926">Meanwhile, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Barak faced off as well.</p>
<p id="line_927">“Don’t worry. Our goal is just to keep you occupied.”</p>
<p id="line_928">“Hmm, you think I’m going to believe that?”</p>
<p id="line_929">“Believe what you want. The fact won’t change.”</p>
<p id="line_930">“It’s you, isn’t it? You’ve been monitoring the surroundings of my house recently.”</p>
<p id="line_931">“…Oh, so you’ve noticed?”</p>
<p id="line_932">“So you’re admitting to it. Then I can’t trust such a suspicious person!”</p>
<p id="line_933">With that, both sides swiftly entered combat mode. The battles between the two pairs were incredibly fierce and evenly matched.</p>
<p id="line_934">“A-amazing…”</p>
<p id="line_935">“Hey hey, there’s no opening for us to step in.”</p>
<p id="line_936">“Even Aslan-san can’t overpower him; that guy is strong!”</p>
<p id="line_937">“Same over there. Barak-san, he’s rumored to be the undefeated captain of the royal guard, ya know? That guy is holding his own against such a superhuman…”</p>
<p id="line_938">Those who watched the battle from the sidelines could only marvel at the sheer disparity in strength they witnessed. If those men had been serious, they realized, their lives would have been forfeit long ago. Some were struck speechless by this realization.</p>
<p id="line_939">Meanwhile, amidst the turmoil…</p>
<p id="line_940">“Tch, he’s tougher than I expected. I wanted to settle this before the General arrived, but it’s tough with just swords,” sighed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, deflecting Aslan’s magical curved blade with both hands grasping his long sword. Surprisingly, Aslan’s physical strength surpassed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s.</p>

<p id="line_947">“Fufuh, well. I just feel a bit happy because you’re strong.”</p>
<p id="line_948">“What did you say?”</p>

<p id="line_952">Aslan held the advantage in strength, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> surpassed him in stamina.

In terms of physical prowess alone, Barak had the upper hand. However, when utilizing all skills, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> proved to be the stronger one.

<p id="line_961">“You craven…”</p>
<p id="line_962">Barak groaned, realizing their defeat at this point. With his cold and observant martial eyes, Barak declared defeat, halting the fight.</p>
<p id="line_963">Despite Barak giving up, Aslan did not admit defeat. In reality, even from this point, there was still a possibility of a turnaround.</p>
<p id="line_964">However, before the conclusion was reached, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> achieved their goal.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_966">“Sorry for the wait!” I called out as I descended into the square. <em>Wait, did <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> win? </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still seemed to be struggling, but if things continued as they were, his victory seemed assured. Had he lost, it would have been troublesome, but now they would surely listen to me.</p>
<p id="line_967"><em>Oh</em>, before anything else, I gently laid Princess Zenobia, whom I had been carrying, onto the ground. She was weakened and still asleep. Prince Aslan’s voice cut through the tension. “What have you done to Zenobia?!” he demanded, but I postponed my response.</p>
<p id="line_968">«Report. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the individual: Zenobia is complete.

Can be removed by Unique Skill Gluttony. Do you wish to proceed? YES/NO»</p>
<p id="line_969"><em>Oh, good</em>. I selected “YES” and awoke Princess Zenobia. “<em>Cough, cough</em>… You’re really something, Mister. I never thought it would be so easy to wake me up,” she said as her first words, her pure eyes staring at me. Being called ‘Mister’ made me cringe. My appearance certainly didn’t match that of a Mister, so I should correct that.</p>
<p id="line_970">“I’m not ‘Mister,’ please call me Satoru,” I said, pulling out a jar of honey. It was known for curing all kinds of ailments and providing very high nutritional value. I judged it was necessary for Princess Zenobia, who had lost much of her strength and was in a state of decline.</p>
<p id="line_971">“Well, thank you very much, Great Phantom Thief Satoru-sama!” Zenobia said gratefully. <em>Ah!</em> By the time I realized it was dangerous, it was already too late. “Great Phantom Thief?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, puzzled.</p>
<p id="line_972">“Well, you see—”</p>
<p id="line_973">“Yes! Satoru-sama introduced himself as such. He visited me in the middle of the night, and his plan to abduct me from the castle was brilliant. Truly worthy of being called the Great Phantom Thief.”</p>
<p id="line_974"><em>Aaaaaah!</em> I should have kept my mouth shut. I never imagined I’d be exposed like this. Why did I have to introduce myself as the Great Phantom Thief? I got carried away trying to look cool, but I should have stayed calm.</p>
<p id="line_975"><em>Grow up, self</em>—though I was 37 in my previous life…</p>
<p id="line_976">As I thought about wanting to punch the version of myself from a while ago that said my heart was still that of a little boy, I thought about how to cover it up.</p>
<p id="line_977">Just when I thought I had run out of good ideas, Crown Prince Sauzer’s arrival became a welcome distraction. “The central road is being approached by about a hundred cavalrymen, led by Crown Prince Sauzer himself,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> reported. He had scouted the royal castle with the clones he had dispatched earlier and had quickly detected the enemy’s movements.</p>
<p id="line_978">“Oh, they’re moving exactly as expected,” I said. Prince Aslan, who had been ignored for some time, stepped forward. “You there, don’t just be satisfied with your own understanding; explain so even we can understand!”</p>
<p id="line_979"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> intercepted Aslan, locking eyes with him. They reached no resolution, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was on the brink of victory. Perhaps it would have been better to settle things clearly, but with little time before Sauzer’s arrival, I decided to clarify things. “Listen carefully: Crown Prince Sauzer is not a vampire. He’s perfectly fine under sunlight and has no need to draw energy from Princess Zenobia.”</p>
<p id="line_980">“What?! Don’t talk nonsense! Then why did my sister suffer?” Prince Aslan demanded, clearly not convinced. His reaction was as I had anticipated. The notion that Sauzer was a vampire was the trump card of Aslan’s faction, and I knew he wouldn’t easily accept it. But it was the truth.</p>
<p id="line_981">“Brother, please listen!” Princess Zenobia interjected. “Just as Satoru-sama says, Elder Brother treated me kindly. He never sought to use me. Like you, brother, he cared for my well-being!”</p>
<p id="line_982">“Then I ask you this! Who orchestrated your collapse?”</p>
<p id="line_983">“That’s—”</p>
<p id="line_984">“It was Court Physician Gustav,” I cut in, seizing the moment.</p>
<p id="line_985">“So, that conniving fox was the mastermind all along?” Aslan asked.</p>
<p id="line_986">“Is this true?” Sauzer, the country’s crown prince—who had arrived with his entourage—asked as well. I had timed my entrance into the square based on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s information, intending to reveal the true mastermind.</p>
<p id="line_987">“…!”</p>
<p id="line_988">“…Your reaction seems genuine. So, Gustav truly was the mastermind?”</p>
<p id="line_989">“Brother, I’ve always suspected you were under Gustav’s influence…”</p>
<p id="line_990">“Don’t look down on me! But if Gustav did harm Zenobia, I have no grounds to act all high and mighty.”</p>
<p id="line_991">The two princes carefully studied each other’s reactions. They judged the sincerity of each other’s words and found themselves bewildered.</p>
<p id="line_992">“Satoru-sama lifted my curse and healed my eyes!” Princess Zenobia interjected. “He also listened to my plea and is trying to reconcile you, my brothers. There is no falsehood in my words; Gustav is the one tormenting me!”</p>
<p id="line_993">Despite still recovering from years of confinement, Princess Zenobia stood up, her body not fully healed yet she declared defiantly. The two princes couldn’t hide their agitation and began to seriously consider each other’s claims.</p>
<p id="line_994">“Yeah, perhaps I should have heard it directly from you,” Crown Prince Sauzer admitted. “Instead, Karl told me that you had treacherous intentions—yes, why did I end up trusting Karl instead of you?”</p>
<p id="line_995">“Karl, you say?” Prince Aslan echoed. “My friend told you… Could it be?!”</p>
<p id="line_996">Who was Karl… Yes, I remembered now.</p>
<p id="line_997">He was a longtime friend of Aslan, who had fabricated evidence about the Origin Blood.</p>
<p id="line_998">“I heard from Karl too,” Aslan said. “He claimed you had taken the Origin Blood and turned into a vampire.”</p>
<p id="line_999">“Hmph, unbelievable. So that man played both sides and deceived us both brothers…” Sauzer concluded.</p>
<p id="line_1000">The realization hit both princes as they exchanged glances. “Where is Karl?“ “Find him! Capture him at once!” they ordered, and their loyal followers sprang into action. Even Barak-san bellowed orders.</p>
<p id="line_1001">The square in front of the guild branch descended into chaos. Amid the turmoil, a laugh that seemed out of place echoed through the area.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" id="story-8" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/title_cards/story-8.png"/></div>
<p class="pagebreak" id="line_1002"></p>
<h1 class="ch-number">Story 8</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Coleus’s Dream Part 4</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_1003">“Haaaaaa-ha-ha-ha!! What a shame, what a shame. We were so close to enjoying the greatest spectacle by those fools. Did you say you’re Satoru? Thanks to you, uncultured swine, our plans are ruined.”</p>
<p id="line_1004">Leaning against the guild building’s wall, the slender, gentle-looking man laughed. He wore a ring with a purple gem embedded in it. His skin was tan, though less sun-kissed than most. Half of his face was obscured by pale purple hair, but his lips were twisted into a sneer. Without any intention to deceive, he laughed openly at those who had fallen into his traps.</p>
<p id="line_1005">It irritated me. Calling me uncultured? This man could only write trivial scripts for third-rate plays, yet he acted so superior.</p>
<p id="line_1006">However…</p>
<p id="line_1007">“Karl!”</p>
<p id="line_1008">“You dare show yourself so brazenly. Don’t think you’ll get away unscathed!”</p>
<p id="line_1009">The subordinates of both princes surrounded Karl, but he remained relaxed and composed. That was to be expected.</p>
<p id="line_1010">“Hmph, mere small fry. You dare to boast so arrogantly, yet you’re only worthy of dancing on my stage.”</p>
<p id="line_1011">“You!” A loud noise echoed, followed by a shockwave that seemed to shake the air. Crown Prince Sauzer struck Karl. However, to everyone’s surprise, Karl was unharmed. After Sauzer withdrew his fist, Karl’s distorted face returned to normal. Not a drop of blood was shed, nor did he show any signs of damage. Sauzer, who concealed an incredible amount of magicules even from my perspective, looked shocked. It was clear he hadn’t held back.</p>
<p id="line_1012"><em>This is bad</em>, I thought.</p>
<p id="line_1013">“Gustaaav! If we kill these guys, will it affect the plan?” Karl asked, looking into the empty sky. It was now clear Gustav was in on it too, but we had to survive this situation first to use that information.</p>
<p id="line_1014">In response to Karl’s call, space began to distort—a sign of Spatial Transportation.</p>
<p id="line_1015">“My, my, weren’t we instructed to keep a low profile? And now we find ourselves having to act. No choice. Let’s finish this quickly and eliminate any evidence.”</p>
<p id="line_1016">“Gustav, so you were involved too!”</p>
<p id="line_1017">“Hmm, you were an excellent pawn for me, but it’s time to take back that power of yours.” As Gustav spoke, the meaning of his words became evident. Crown Prince Sauzer’s presence diminished rapidly.</p>
<p id="line_1018">«Report. Individual: Sauzer has experienced a rapid decrease in contained magicules. Simultaneously, individual: Gustav has shown a significant increase in magicules.»</p>
<p id="line_1019">It was a transfer of power. There was no room to question if it was possible; the phenomenon was real. With his regained power, Gustav’s appearance grew more ominous. He didn’t look entirely inhuman, but the whites of his eyes had turned pale purple. This change was true for Karl as well. While Gustav now held more magicules, they seemed to be of the same race.</p>
<p id="line_1020">«Affirmative. Checking the race in question… They are presumed to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. Given their incarnation, their threat level exceeds that of the Orc Disaster.»</p>
<p id="line_1021"><em>H-hmmm</em>. To think there were two of them simultaneously. The revelation of this dangerous fact startled even me.</p>
<p id="line_1022">“Satoru-sama…” Princess Zenobia looked at me with worry.</p>
<p id="line_1023">To reassure her, I smiled. “Don’t worry. I’ll keep my promise.”</p>
<p id="line_1024">Without sacrificing anyone, we had to defeat two <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s equivalent to a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Seed. Honestly, it would be tough, but I was a man of my word.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1025">Dealing with two at once was troublesome—I was considering countermeasures, but fortunately, the heavens hadn’t abandoned me.</p>
<p id="line_1026">“Gu-fu-fu. Karl, can you handle these insects and wipe them all out on your own?”</p>
<p id="line_1027">“Of course. Gustav, are you willing to let me take care of this?”</p>
<p id="line_1028">“Given the circumstances, we must revise our strategy. We cannot risk damaging the vessel, so I shall prepare the battlefield.”</p>
<p id="line_1029">“I appreciate that. Thank you for your kindness,” Karl said, expressing his gratitude. Without waiting for a response, Gustav moved. Without chanting a spell, he used Spatial Transportation, appearing behind Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_1030">By the time I realized it, it was already too late. A suspicious Barrier had formed, encompassing the crowd in the square. Yet, I remained calm. Gustav’s mention of a ‘vessel’ made sense—he was referring to Princess Zenobia. It seemed the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> intended to eliminate the elder princes but were reluctant to harm Princess Zenobia, likely because she was crucial for some purpose. This was fortunate for us.</p>
<p id="line_1031">«Report. This Barrier is an Isolation Barrier that isolates the influences of the physical world. It can be destroyed by the Unique Skill Gluttony. Do you wish to proceed? YES/NO.»</p>
<p id="line_1032">The analysis from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> brought me a sense of composure. If the barrier could be broken at any time, there was no need to panic. Instead, it was an opportunity to swiftly dispose of one of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That was my calm judgment. However, there was someone whose emotions got the better of them—the elder prince.</p>
<p id="line_1033">“You scoundrel, Gustav!” Crown Prince Sauzer shouted, his voice filled with rage. He believed his sister had been abducted. Though he seemed to have reverted to his original frail state, showing no promise in combat, his determined eyes remained unchanged as he glared at Gustav, who he now saw not just as a traitor but as the mastermind behind it all.</p>
<p id="line_1034">“You’re no longer of any use. Well then, die!” Mocking Sauzer’s outburst, Karl unleashed a blast of magic.</p>
<p id="line_1035">But at that moment—</p>
<p id="line_1036">“Brother!” Prince Aslan cried out and shielded Crown Prince Sauzer.</p>
<p id="line_1037">“Aslan! Why…why did you protect me?!” Sauzer lamented as he tried to lift the collapsed Prince Aslan.</p>
<p id="line_1038">“Gu-fu-fu. The sight of the weak lamenting is always a delight,” Gustav’s joyful voice echoed. While maintaining the Isolation Barrier, he could still observe what was happening inside. Since we could see Gustav and Princess Zenobia, it seemed the barrier only blocked physical influences.</p>
<p id="line_1039">“That’s right. Those emotions are truly delicious. Please, entertain me more!” From his words, it became clear that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fed on human emotions like nourishment. As troublesome and vile as they were, I couldn’t complain since they were underestimating us.</p>
<p id="line_1040">“Hm, I…wish to be your shield…and your sword against your enemies… It’s a wish I’ve had since childhood… If only you weren’t deceived…” Aslan murmured weakly.</p>
<p id="line_1041">“Oh, Aslan, how foolish…I love…” Crown Prince Sauzer began, but there was no time for sentiment. Gustav and Karl watched the exchange with amusement. It might have been moving, but now wasn’t the time for such things. I had no intention of getting involved in the drama.</p>
<p id="line_1042">Ignoring the mood, I took action. “Alright, alright, you’re in the way. Here, take this!” I presented a healing potion to Prince Aslan, who was on the brink of death from a single magic blast. This would heal his wounds and restore him to full health.</p>
<p id="line_1043">“ “ “ “Huh?!” ” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_1044">Gustav, Karl, and Aslan’s voices harmonized perfectly in surprise.</p>
<p id="line_1045">“Y-you! What in the world is that ridiculous healing potion?!” Karl shouted, his voice grating, but I had no obligation to answer him. Ignoring his outrage, I then presented honey to Crown Prince Sauzer.</p>
<p id="line_1046">“You’re in the way, so take this and back down.” Though he seemed frail, this would likely improve his condition. However, since he couldn’t be expected to perform well in battle, it was best for him to stay out of the way.</p>
<p id="line_1047">Now that I had finished assessing the situation, I had also devised a plan.</p>
<p id="line_1048">‹<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, are you ready?›</p>

<p id="line_1052">‹Hm, of course.›</p>
<p id="line_1053">‹The folly of his actions shall be repaid with his own life.›</p>

<p id="line_1055">“Listen up, we’ll take him down together. The rest of you, stay out of the way and take cover on the sidelines!”</p>
<p id="line_1056">With those words as my signal, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-slaying began.</p>

This meant he was fully aware of what had transpired in front of him and was stunned by the seriousness of the situation. His comrades were trapped within the Barrier. Even the enemies they had been fighting against had now joined forces to confront the true mastermind. The situation was dire.</p>
<p id="line_1058"><em>There’s no way we can win against them, right?!</em> Paulo thought, panic rising within him. <em>They’re <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, and there are two of them!</em> Even ten A rank adventurers wouldn’t guarantee victory.

<p id="line_1059">He then remembered something in his waist pouch: the absurd healing potion given to him by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The moment he touched it, Paulo felt an inexplicable calm wash over him. The fear was still there, but the trembling in his hands and feet disappeared. Regaining his composure, he surveyed the situation and saw the person held captive by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> known as Gustav. It was Princess Zenobia—fragile and someone who needed to be protected.</p>
<p id="line_1060"><em>Come to think of it, I wanted to be a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came to mind. Although he didn’t look like a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his actions were extraordinary. Paulo hadn’t said it aloud, but he realized that even with all his effort, he couldn’t match <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s competence. The weapon <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had casually handed him was likely on par with unique-grade weapons.</p>
<p id="line_1061"><em>He trusted me enough to give me something so valuable… That’s right! If it’s him, even in times like this—</em></p>
<p id="line_1062"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was currently unjustly imprisoned in the castle.

It was a reckless plan with no guarantees.</p>
<p id="line_1063">“Don’t be reckless.

I’ll do what I can do. Even if it ends in failure, I’ll face it with pride!</em></p>
<p id="line_1064">With newfound resolve, Paulo quietly stoked his fighting spirit.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1065">Gustav watched with a twisted pleasure as his colleague Karl fought. Believing themselves to be the strongest, he never expected they would lose to mere humans. However, his confidence would soon be shattered.</p>
<p id="line_1066"><em>That’s absurd! He nullified Karl’s magic?</em></p>
<p id="line_1067">The ones currently facing Karl were strangers from another country. One of them simply waved his hand and dispelled the magic. It was an unbelievable sight. Gustav and Karl stood at the pinnacle of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> race. An <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> incarnate had the potential to rival even a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Magic spells were cast instantly without incantations, yet every attack failed. Karl, who should have been overwhelmingly superior, was outmaneuvered by those who were supposed to be inferior. Gustav now realized the three were not humans, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.</p>
<p id="line_1068">Being incarnated had now become a curse, having been bound by physical restraints. Karl’s body, which should have healed instantly, was having its regeneration ability suppressed by the continuously burning black flames.</p>
<p id="line_1069"><em>This is bad, very bad! If this continues, Karl will be killed. Even if he doesn’t perish, the precious incarnation will be wasted… But even if I help him, there’s no guarantee of victory…</em></p>
<p id="line_1070">This plan was part of a long-term strategy spanning decades. Gustav and Karl’s grand scheme was to manifest and incarnate a deity worshiped by the demonic followers. The reward for this was the highest rank among the direct subordinates of their deity—to become the right-hand man of the manifested Violet Lord, Violet, and rule the world. That was their dream. Yet reality was merciless. Karl’s screams echoed. The mightiest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was being toyed with by unknown <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. If the strongest weapon of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> race, magic, was sealed, Gustav could face the same fate.</p>
<p id="line_1071"><em>This can’t be. Now that the plan has unraveled, any more failures are unacceptable…</em> Originally, the plan was for the prince brothers, heirs to the throne, to kill each other, turning this country into a land of tragedy and despair. Furthermore, by framing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Valentin for the crime, they intended to evoke a sense of crisis among humanity. Yet—all Gustav had left in his hands was Princess Zenobia. She was intended as the vessel for their god, a girl who had to be absolutely protected. Though she was currently asleep, not a single scratch had been inflicted on her.</p>
<p id="line_1072">There were two possible courses of action. The first was to escape with Princess Zenobia. Even if they caused widespread suffering elsewhere, the incarnation of their god could still be achieved without being tied to the Kingdom of Coleus. Even this alone would fulfill Gustav’s ambition, but—<em>No, that’s unacceptable. If it were known that I had devised such a sloppy plan, I would be eliminated by the great one. Terrifying. That must be avoided at all costs…</em></p>
<p id="line_1073">If he earned the god’s favor, he would have all the glory in this world. However, if he incurred disfavor, Gustav’s very existence would be erased from this world. Violet was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> being and the origin of Gustav and Karl. Hence, Violet held the power of life and death over them, and beings like Gustav and Karl existed solely for her. Therefore, Gustav had no choice but to take the remaining option.</p>
<p id="line_1074">Gustav laid the sleeping Princess Zenobia at his feet and resorted to a forbidden method. “Veil of the Dark Night, descend! Source of all negative emotions, come forth! My kin, ‘Karl,’ become my sustenance!” He fortified the Isolation Barrier with multiple layers to prevent interference, blocking visibility both inside and outside. With this in place, he gathered power by absorbing the negative emotions across the Kingdom of Coleus. It was an inefficient enhancement method with only a brief effect for the effort it required, but that momentary boost was enough. The true objective lay in merging with his kin—in other words, a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fusion.</p>
<p id="line_1075">As spiritual lifeforms, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could steal a portion of their enemy’s power by killing them. Furthermore, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the same lineage could fuse for super-enhancement. The fused power of both entities would result in the one with the stronger will taking control. As this would lead to the disappearance of the other entity, it was considered taboo. However, it was a quintessentially demonic method of survival and power enhancement.</p>
<p id="line_1076">The power obtained through this method would mostly dissipate in a few days, leaving only a fraction behind, making it largely meaningless. However, it could be a useful tactic when facing difficult opponents.</p>
<p id="line_1077">Gustav now judged <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his companions as a significant threat. Opting to fight instead of fleeing, he sacrificed Karl to gain power. “Gu-fu-fu. My physical body can’t fully handle this power. It’s only a short-term power-up, but it’s more than enough to slaughter those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. With this strength, even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Valentin would be like a mere infant! Now, let’s begin!” Muttering to no one in particular, Gustav made his declaration.</p>
<p id="line_1078">He intended to enter the Isolation Barrier and massacre those inside, who were still in disarray. Though using nuclear magic would be the simplest way to dispatch them, it wouldn’t leave behind any corpses, which would be problematic for the plan. The narrative had to remain that the two princes killed each other. Having seen one of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s cancel out magic, Gustav wanted to ensure no mistakes.</p>
<p id="line_1079">He was about to step forward when he noticed something strange. Princess Zenobia had disappeared. No, a suspicious man was trying to abduct her. “Who are you, daring to get in my way?!” Gustav’s anger flared at being outwitted by a mere human. Normally, such a thing would be impossible, but he was caught off guard during the taboo moment of demonic fusion.</p>
<p id="line_1080">The one who accomplished this feat was Paulo, who had recovered with the healing potion. He overcame his fear and moved forward with the plan. Holding Princess Zenobia in his arms, Paulo ran desperately. She was petite and not a burden for Paulo. With his near-A rank speed, he could reach the royal castle in less than a minute. But Gustav would not allow it.</p>
<p id="line_1081">“You fool. Do you think you can escape from me? Dark Magic: Forbidden—”</p>
<p id="line_1082">Princess Zenobia was important, but Paulo was insignificant. Thus, without even chanting a spell, Gustav unleashed his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to destroy Paulo’s heart. However, on the darkened street, shrouded by the veil of the dark night, stood a figure cloaked in pitch-black. With just a wave of her finger, this figure dispersed Gustav’s magic wave. She then spoke to the astonished Paulo.</p>
<p id="line_1083">“Beyond this point lies a Barrier. Don’t run pointlessly; stay there quietly and watch. Out of respect for your intent to save that girl, I will protect you.” Paulo nodded vigorously and sank to the street as instructed.</p>
<p id="line_1084">Gustav pondered. This entire area had been sealed under the king’s name to prevent any interference. As the girl had said, a magical barrier was activated to ensure no one could escape. It was impossible for any townspeople to have infiltrated. Moreover, it was impossible for an ordinary human to interfere with Gustav’s magic. No longer concerned with Paulo, Gustav directed his attention to the intruder.</p>
<p id="line_1085">“Who are you?”</p>
<p id="line_1086">This time, Gustav asked calmly. While his rational mind commanded him to kill the intruder without hesitation, his body did not obey. It was as if Gustav was afraid of this figure…</p>
<p id="line_1087">“I have no intention of revealing myself to someone as insignificant as you!”</p>
<p id="line_1088">“What?!”</p>
<p id="line_1089">“My, my, I actually had no intention of getting involved. Given the current state of that person, dealing with your transformed self might be too much for him. However, since I’m indulging in this, you should consider it an honor.” The figure removed their robe and put it away somewhere.</p>
<p id="line_1090">Revealed was a beautiful silver-haired girl. What stood out most were her eyes—one blue and one red. Her heterochromatic eyes gleamed mystically as she glared at Gustav.</p>
<p id="line_1091">“A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? A brat like you being so cheeky—”</p>
<p id="line_1092">At this moment, Gustav made a fatal mistake. Judging his opponent by appearance alone was a laughable blunder, deserving ridicule from anyone who heard it. The consequences were severe. Even though Gustav struck with a power that exceeded his limits, his punch was effortlessly caught by the girl’s slender arm.</p>
<p id="line_1093">“—What?”</p>
<p id="line_1094">It was charged with immense magical power, capable of obliterating even a castle. Yet, the girl maintained a calm and composed expression. Finally, Gustav realized that this girl was no ordinary person. However, it was already too late.</p>
<p id="line_1095">“Weak.”</p>
<p id="line_1096">“T-that’s absurd! That was my full strength!”</p>
<p id="line_1097">“I don’t care.”</p>
<p id="line_1098">Gustav’s arm was promptly broken, followed by a kick to his abdomen that felt like it could shatter his spine. The force was so intense that he coughed up blood.</p>
<p id="line_1099">“What is this? So you’ve been mimicking humans and eating food? It’s messy and repulsive, so I’ll spare you the torment.”</p>
<p id="line_1100">The girl smirked, revealing small, pure white fangs at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p id="line_1101">“S-so you’re a vampire? And stronger than me?!”</p>
<p id="line_1102">Gustav was shocked and bewildered. He had the confidence to defeat even the famed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Valentin, known as the strongest among vampires. Yet this girl far surpassed his expectations. It was hard to believe, but it was the reality.</p>
<p id="line_1103">“Y-you…W-who are you…?”</p>
<p id="line_1104">“You have no need to know.”</p>
<p id="line_1105">With a cold reply ringing in his ears, Gustav realized his defeat. He understood that he would be destroyed if things continued like this. <em>This is bad! If I do nothing, I’ll perish without achieving anything—! If that happens, I, I—</em></p>
<p id="line_1106">He would incur the wrath of his master. That prospect was more terrifying than death itself. So Gustav took a desperate gamble—but it would lead to an unfortunate outcome for him.</p>
<p id="line_1107">As he leaped backward, Gustav saw Paulo holding the sleeping Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_1108">“You’re a nuisance!”</p>
<p id="line_1109">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_1110">It happened in an instant. In an effort to shield Princess Zenobia, Paulo swiftly twisted his body and stepped forward. Even without understanding Gustav’s intentions, Paulo knew he was up to no good. Thinking quickly, he decided to use his own body as a shield to protect Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_1111"><em>Well, it might be lame and maybe pointless, but this is the best I can do.</em></p>
<p id="line_1112">That was Paulo, doing his utmost in his own way. However, that effort turned out to be his own stroke of luck.</p>
<p id="line_1113">“Heyyy, out of the way!” Gustav shouted and struck Paulo. Because Paulo stepped forward, Gustav was unable to unleash his powerful attack. In his desperation not to involve Princess Zenobia, the attack didn’t become a fatal blow. Most importantly, thanks to Paulo fainting pleasantly from that single strike, he avoided experiencing the terror that was to come.</p>
<p id="line_1114">Without further concern for Paulo, Gustav focused on his ritual. Before him, Gustav deployed multiple layers of Defense Barriers and initiated a simplified ritual.</p>
<p id="line_1115">“O great <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> deity! Reside within this vessel and lend me your power!”</p>
<p id="line_1116">Foolishly, Gustav attempted to manifest a god using Princess Zenobia as a vessel, despite not being fully prepared.</p>
<p id="line_1117">“What a fool,” the girl muttered in disbelief. Having vowed to protect Paulo, she glanced briefly to ensure he was still alive. Satisfied that he was fine, she calmly observed the ritual unfolding before her. The girl could foresee what was to come next.</p>
<p id="line_1118">Princess Zenobia’s body jumped high into the air, floating. She was then enveloped in a dense, purple <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that seemed to surge from the atmosphere, forming a cocoon around her.</p>
<p id="line_1119">“Oh, ohhhhh! It worked! I’ve won this gamble! You’re finished. Whoever you are, you’ll regret going against us!”</p>
<p id="line_1120">Given the incomplete and simplified state of the ritual, the success rate of summoning the god was extremely low. Considering this, Gustav’s joy was immense. As long as the god descended, victory was assured regardless of the opponent. That was what he believed.</p>
<p id="line_1121">However…</p>
<p id="line_1122">The god was incredibly cruel.</p>
<p id="line_1123">“Hello, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I didn’t want to waste the opportunity to at least come and say hello.”</p>
<p id="line_1124">The god spoke not to Gustav, but directly to the girl he was antagonizing.</p>
<p id="line_1125"><em>Eh? Wait, wait a moment. Is the god, Violet-sama, acquainted with this person? No, wait… <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, did she say <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?!

<p id="line_1126">It was an astonishing and shocking revelation. However, even if Gustav now knew the girl’s true identity, there was nothing he could do. He could only tremble and pray that the gods’ attention did not turn toward him.</p>
<p id="line_1127">“Tch, it’s really you after all. Violet, I’ve told you before, stop causing trouble for me.”</p>
<p id="line_1128">“Ahahaha! No way. I love doing things people hate. Especially with someone as shrewd as you—outsmarting you is quite the challenge. Since we’re playing together anyway, I want to have fun too. Looking forward to it!”</p>
<p id="line_1129">“How shameless…”</p>
<p id="line_1130">At that moment, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Violet clashed. They engaged in an intense battle, wielding nothing but their bare hands.</p>
<p id="line_1131"><em>I-I can’t believe it. I’m witnessing a battle of the gods right now! Alright, if Violet-sama can just take care of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—</em></p>
<p id="line_1132">Gustav hoped, but his wish was in vain. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Violet were not serious; they were merely exchanging pleasantries.</p>
<p id="line_1133">“Well, your skills haven’t dulled, it seems. Impressive, impressive.”</p>
<p id="line_1134">“You’re so loud! What about you? How do you plan to settle this?”</p>
<p id="line_1135">“Hmm, let’s see…”</p>
<p id="line_1136">Listening to their conversation, Gustav felt a foreboding sense that things were taking a dangerous turn.</p>
<p id="line_1137">“O-O god, I, I—”</p>
<p id="line_1138">“Yeah. For one of my subordinates, it’s disappointing that you can’t handle even such a simple task. I allowed you to act freely because you happened to be incarnated, but it seems that as an ‘early modern species,’ this is the extent of your wit. How unfortunate!”</p>
<p id="line_1139">“Wait! Next time, next time for sure I will definitely succeed. Even this time, I have accomplished incarnating you—”</p>
<p id="line_1140">“Hahh? I only manifested my power forcibly through this child’s body.”</p>
<p id="line_1141">“Heh?!”</p>
<p id="line_1142">“You have no accomplishments to speak of. Don’t make me laugh.”</p>
<p id="line_1143">A very cold gaze pierced through Gustav.</p>
<p id="line_1144">“I’m disappointed. If you’re going to leave evidence, then I’ll have to deal with you myself.” Violet said. “It’s such a hassle,” she added, looking exasperated.</p>
<p id="line_1145">Upon hearing that, for some reason, Gustav misunderstood. Believing the words were directed at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> rather than himself, he approached Violet with a jubilant expression.</p>
<p id="line_1146">“Oh, oooh! If it’s you, surely you’ll be able to take Lumina’s head —”</p>
<p id="line_1147">Violet’s patience with Gustav’s attitude finally reached its limit.</p>
<p id="line_1148">“Idiooot.”</p>
<p id="line_1149">“W-wait, what—?!”</p>
<p id="line_1150">Not a second later, she pronounced his death sentence with a sing-song voice.</p>
<p id="line_1151">“Disappear, trash.”</p>
<p id="line_1152">“N-no, Abuaah!”</p>
<p id="line_1153">And so, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that had incarnated and assimilated with Court Physician Gustav was sent plummeting into hell by Violet’s hand.</p>
<p id="line_1154">“Well then, I’m off. Bye-bye!”</p>
<p id="line_1155">“Hmph! Truly capricious and exceedingly troublesome.”</p>
<p id="line_1156">Left behind, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> muttered discontentedly. She had come to observe someone of interest but ended up completely entangled in this mess. It was strictly forbidden to reveal her presence to that person, which had put her in quite a predicament.</p>
<p id="line_1157">With the disappearance of the caster, the Isolation Barrier also vanished. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, while grateful that Gustav made multiple layers of barriers, contemplated her next move. Then, she recalled the unconscious person.</p>
<p id="line_1158">It was none other than Paulo. She generously healed his wounds with restoration magic and woke him up. Then—</p>
<p id="line_1159">“You, come closer.”</p>
<p id="line_1160">“Y-yes!”</p>
<p id="line_1161">Paulo stepped forward as commanded. Understanding <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as an absolute powerhouse, he had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p id="line_1162"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smiled sweetly, her eyes glimmering with a mystical light.</p>
<p id="line_1163">“Listen closely. You knocked this guy out with that stick, didn’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_1164">“Yes! I knocked him out!”</p>
<p id="line_1165">“Umu, good.”</p>
<p id="line_1166">It was a moment where the vampires’ specialty, Charm, demonstrated its true effectiveness.</p>
<p id="line_1167">Thus, having framed Paulo as the culprit, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> washed her hands of the matter and fled the scene, leaving everything else behind.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1168">We were trapped within the Isolation Barrier, but it made the battle easier for us. I dispelled the magic, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immobilized Karl, and then <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> struck him down. It was a completely one-sided and effortless victory. However, just as we were about to deliver the finishing blow, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p id="line_1169">Karl suddenly collapsed. He wasn’t dead but unconscious. Moreover, he had aged drastically and lost all his strength.</p>
<p id="line_1170">“It seems like he’s reverted back to being just a human,” I said, and everyone nodded.</p>
<p id="line_1171">«Report. The flow of power has been confirmed. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> assimilated with the individual: Karl appeared to have been absorbed by the individual: Gustav.»</p>
<p id="line_1172">Were they fighting among themselves?</p>
<p id="line_1173">Anyway, if Karl was incapacitated, it was Gustav’s turn next. With that determination, I stepped outside the Isolation Barrier to find Gustav lying on the ground and Paulo standing with his staff at the ready.</p>
<p id="line_1174">“Eh, you defeated him?”</p>
<p id="line_1175">“Yes! I did it!” Paulo cheerfully replied.</p>
<p id="line_1176">«Answer. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fusion is considered taboo and highly difficult. In unforeseen circumstances, the likelihood of failure is high.»</p>
<p id="line_1177">So, Paulo’s well-timed blow caused the ritual to fail? If that was true, Paulo had scored a surprise victory. It was hard to believe, but Gustav’s menacing presence had vanished. Moreover, searching the vicinity revealed no signs of any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lurking around.</p>
<p id="line_1178">«Report. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> cannot sustain their existence without a host. It’s not possible for them to possess just anyone, so it’s reasonable to assume the individual was defeated.»</p>
<p id="line_1179">While there was a possibility he escaped, the threat had ceased. Then, there was no point in further pursuit. Though I was not fully satisfied, this was where it ended. What was more important was the safety of Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_1180">I rushed to her side as she lay on the ground to check her condition. Breathing and pulse were normal. She was weakened but otherwise in good health.</p>
<p id="line_1181">“Zenobia! Is she alright?”</p>
<p id="line_1182">“Brother, please calm down. Let’s trust Satoru-dono.”</p>
<p id="line_1183">Crown Prince Sauzer, who had hurried over, asked me with concern, and Prince Aslan intervened to reassure him. For some reason, their trust in me seemed to have grown.</p>
<p id="line_1184">“I don’t see any physical issues. She should wake up shortly.”</p>
<p id="line_1185">I debated using formal language, but it felt too late for that. Currently, I was posing as the Great Phantom Thief. While knowing it might be inappropriate, I responded in my usual manner.</p>
<p id="line_1186">“I appreciate it.”</p>
<p id="line_1187">“Now, Great Phantom Thief, I have an important question for you. May I ask?”</p>
<p id="line_1188">The princes expressed their gratitude to me. Afterward, Crown Prince Sauzer looked at me with a formal demeanor. I had a strong, unpleasant feeling about this. If they were to ask something like, “As the Great Phantom Thief, have you stolen something?” it would quickly become a serious problem.</p>
<p id="line_1189">Maybe I was overthinking, but before things became troublesome—</p>
<p id="line_1190">“Sorry, but we’re quite busy ourselves. We’ll take our leave now.”</p>
<p id="line_1191">I replied and then called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Activating Spatial Transportation, we swiftly retreated from the scene.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1192">I woke up in the cell. Stretching my arms, I casually remarked, “Hmm, I slept well.” The guard, looking somewhat exasperated, responded, “Hey, you’re quite bold. To sleep in a situation like this—what kind of heart do you have?”</p>
<p id="line_1193">I chuckled, “Haha, my heart is quite special.” Of course, as a slime, I didn’t actually have a heart.</p>
<p id="line_1194">The conversation took on an unexpectedly relaxed tone. With the mastermind caught, the case resolved, and my innocence proven, I was about to be released. So, I decided to enjoy the brief experience of being in prison.</p>
<p id="line_1195">Sure enough, after a short while, a commotion erupted, and a messenger soldier rushed in. “U-urgent order from Crown Prince Sauzer: release that person from the cell immediately!”</p>
<p id="line_1196">“W-what?!”</p>
<p id="line_1197">Just as expected, I was freed. Since my attire hadn’t changed, there was no need to tidy up my appearance. Without any guidance, I was greeted directly by the princes.</p>
<p id="line_1198">Prince Aslan spoke immediately, “I apologize, but my sister has become weakened once again. If possible, could you share some of your secret medicine? I would appreciate it.”</p>
<p id="line_1199">Although I had anticipated her waking up soon, Aslan seemed genuinely concerned for his sister. Understanding his worry, I gladly handed over the honey.</p>
<p id="line_1200">The guard who had been watching us spoke up in disbelief, “Where on earth did you…”</p>
<p id="line_1201">Seeing the princes treating me with such formality after our casual chat seemed to baffle him. I felt a bit of sympathy for his confusion.</p>
<p id="line_1202">Prince Aslan passed the honey to Crown Prince Sauzer. Sauzer examined it and said, “Hmm, just as I suspected. It’s the same as what I received.”</p>
<p id="line_1203">“So it was indeed the case,” Aslan agreed, nodding—<em>Ah!</em></p>
<p id="line_1204"><em>Wait, could it be? Are they suspecting that ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and the Great Phantom Thief ‘Satoru’ are the same person?! I done did it, what a huge blunder,</em> I thought but it was too late to fix it now.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1205">We moved to a luxurious reception room, where I sat facing three people. Behind them stood Barak-san and, for some reason, Paulo. They seemed to be acting as guards, but Paulo’s presence was puzzling.</p>
<p id="line_1206">Princess Zenobia had already awakened, and she didn’t need the honey after all. It appeared that I had been tested, but since nothing had been exposed, I decided to put my worries aside. Although the honey was evidence, they hadn’t uncovered my skills, so I could still avoid responsibility.</p>
<p id="line_1207">To my surprise, they didn’t pursue the matter any further.</p>
<p id="line_1208">“Thanks to you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I am now free. I intend to study hard and broaden my horizons to serve my brothers well,” said Princess Zenobia.</p>
<p id="line_1209">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, I owe you everything. I am deeply grateful,” added Prince Aslan.</p>
<p id="line_1210">“Without your cooperation, we wouldn’t have been able to converse like this. The thought of continuing a blood-soaked struggle among ourselves is chilling. We feel deeply indebted to you. Please remember this, and don’t hesitate to rely on us if anything arises,” said Crown Prince Sauzer.</p>
<p id="line_1211">Each of the three expressed their gratitude in their own way, and it seemed they had figured out more than I initially thought. But sometimes, it was better to leave things unsaid.</p>
<p id="line_1212">“Likewise. I’m glad I could be of help, even in a small way. If you ever need more medicine, please visit the merchant <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I’m sure he’ll assist you willingly,” I replied, subtly promoting our potions. I was determined to make the most of opportunities to promote my nation’s potions.</p>
<p id="line_1213">Prince Aslan chuckled. “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a merchant associated with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nation that has recently risen in power, I see.”</p>
<p id="line_1214">“Speaking of which, the chancellor of that country is named <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Tempest, it seems. What a coincidence,” added Crown Prince Sauzer with a nod.</p>
<p id="line_1215">Their ability to gather information was impressive, or rather, it was so obvious that there was no point in trying to cover it up anymore. I could only smile wryly at the situation.</p>
<p id="line_1216">“When did you realize it?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_1217">Crown Prince Sauzer explained, “I thought it might be rude, but once you healed Zenobia, we sent someone to investigate. The report just arrived a moment ago.” He showed no sign of thinking it was rude at all.</p>
<p id="line_1218">As the future king of a military nation responsible for guarding the remote reaches, it was only natural that he would have such tricks. I noted that there were things I could learn from him and hoped we could get along well in the future.</p>
<p id="line_1219">Oh right, let’s not forget about the king, who is suspected to be the mastermind. “So, I remembered something. Was it indeed the king of this country who was manipulating you brothers to fight?”</p>
<p id="line_1220">“Well, about that, actually—“ Princess Zenobia began to explain the fate of the king.</p>
<p id="line_1221">………</p>
<p id="line_1222">……</p>
<p id="line_1223">…</p>
<p id="line_1224">Deep within the Kingdom of Coleus, in a private chamber accessible only to nobility, King Tedron sat with a fierce scowl on his face. “That incompetent fool! He has betrayed my expectations…”</p>
<p id="line_1225">Approaching old age and weakened in strength, Tedron’s eyes burned with a fierce desire. He was the mastermind behind the scenes, orchestrating everything with a desperate resolve. With his life nearing its end, Tedron had nothing to lose and had taken a colossal gamble. He loathed the idea of relinquishing power and plotted to transfer his consciousness into a youthful prince.</p>
<p id="line_1226">The situation was further complicated by Tedron’s unfortunate depth of knowledge. Skilled in ancient magic, he, in collaboration with several mages, had successfully performed the forbidden summoning of an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which was then transferred into Court Physician Gustav. With the strongest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as his right-hand man, Tedron’s plan had initially progressed smoothly. The two princes were at odds, and a clash seemed inevitable. Tedron anticipated that he would soon possess the victor.</p>
<p id="line_1227">However, meticulously laid plans unraveled and vanished due to an unwelcome guest.</p>
<p id="line_1228">“Damn it! If it comes to this, then I’ll personally take on a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> within my own body!” Tedron growled. With his time running out, he could afford no errors, leading him to contemplate reckless actions.</p>
<p id="line_1229">Yet, such actions were not permitted.</p>
<p id="line_1230">“Fool. It is because you indulged in such foolish actions that you allowed Violet’s schemes to flourish. This country was also a safeguard against the Mad King, and had you quietly protected this land, I would have granted you a reward in your dying moments,” a voice echoed.</p>
<p id="line_1231">“Wha—who are you? Who dares—”</p>
<p id="line_1232">“You, of all people, still wonder who I am?”</p>
<p id="line_1233">“I-it can’t be?”</p>
<p id="line_1234">It was only then that Tedron finally saw the source of the voice. Reclining elegantly on the couch, more poised than the room’s master, was the beautiful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1235">“You are the Guardian of the West—”</p>
<p id="line_1236">“I offer no mercy. Reflect on your transgressions in Hell for dabbling in forbidden matters.”</p>
<p id="line_1237">Those were the last words Tedron heard before his life was forcibly drained. He endured a tormented demise until his life finally ceased.</p>
<p id="line_1238">The following morning, the death of King Tedron, who had long ruled the country, was quietly confirmed.</p>
<p id="line_1239">………</p>
<p id="line_1240">……</p>
<p id="line_1241">…</p>
<p id="line_1242">“And so, by the time soldiers moved to apprehend him, the king had already passed away,” Princess Zenobia concluded.</p>
<p id="line_1243">Crown Prince Sauzer then explained, “Well, off the record, it might have turned out for the best. By the charges, the death penalty was the only outcome, but I didn’t want to bear the stain of patricide.”</p>
<p id="line_1244">Sauzer’s demeanor had already taken on the aura of a king, and it seemed he would soon be crowned. With this matter settled, it felt as though all problems had truly been resolved.</p>
<p id="line_1245">Deeply relieved, I lost track of time as we chatted over dinner. For some reason, Princess Zenobia mentioned having lost her unique skill, while Paulo announced his acceptance into the Kingdom of Coleus and his appointment as the Knight Commander. Prince Aslan would support King Sauzer as the Minister of Military Affairs.</p>
<p id="line_1246">The next day, I bid everyone farewell and began my journey home. Paulo did not accompany me. Originally, he was to undergo a promotion review, but since he decided to retire from adventuring and take up employment, there was no longer any need for him to return to the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1247">Unlike the journey there, the return was swift. As soon as everyone was out of sight, I activated Elemental Magic: Warp Portal.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklets 5/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1248">“I see you’ve returned quite quickly.

<p id="line_1249">“Of course. Not only did I gather information, but I also managed to resolve the issue,” I replied.</p>
<p id="line_1250">“It’s so impressive, it’s almost unbelievable.”</p>
<p id="line_1251"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> chuckled wryly, and I proceeded to explain the whole story.</p>
<p id="line_1252">“Thank you so much for everything this time. Thanks to you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, we were able to prevent the Coleus branch’s separation. We’ve also saved face for the headquarters, and I believe our archaeological exploration in that region will proceed smoothly from now on.”</p>
<p id="line_1253">“I see, that’s good to hear.”</p>
<p id="line_1254">Seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> so pleased, I felt that my efforts had been worthwhile. With that, the mission was officially concluded.</p>
<p id="line_1255">The next day, I showed up at the academy. I reunited with the kids sooner than I had expected, but—</p>
<p id="line_1256">“Hey, Sensei, did you miss us while you were away?”</p>
<p id="line_1257">“Tiss-sensei’s lessons were so clear and thorough, even more than yours, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_1258">“Yeah, yeah! But I found your lessons more fun, Sensei.”</p>
<p id="line_1259">“Ahaha. They say this, but everyone was feeling lonely without you, Sensei—”</p>
<p id="line_1260">“Geez, Gale, you’re so noisy!”</p>
<p id="line_1261">“Ufufu, I’m glad <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei has returned. Welcome back!”</p>
<p id="line_1262">“ “ “Welcome back!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_1263">At Chloe’s signal, everyone welcomed me back with smiles. It made me happy because I had grown fond of this life.</p>
<p id="line_1264">And so, my short but intense vacation came to an end. Even though I didn’t really rest, seeing the kids’ smiles made it all worthwhile.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1265">In the future, the Kingdom of Coleus was abuzz with surprising news: the birth of a new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, known as “Newbie” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_1266">Reactions to this news varied widely.</p>
<p id="line_1267">“Well! He’s grown up so beautifully, but now I guess I won’t be able to marry him. What a shame.”</p>
<p id="line_1268">“Hmph, with that kind of strength, being called a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> makes sense.”</p>

And I even got this six-foot staff from him… What should I do?”</p>
<p id="line_1273">Knight Commander Paulo of the feared and formidable Kingdom of Coleus spent the following days with a pale, anxious face, fretting over his situation.</p>
<p id="line_1274">However, there was no need for concern. Paulo was a person of great fortune, having survived without ever encountering Violet, thanks to being unconscious during the ordeal.</p>
<p id="line_1275">As expected, he would later become known as “He who mooched off a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
