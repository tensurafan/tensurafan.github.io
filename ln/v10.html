Their willingness to partake in the conquest business was higher than we imagined. Some were quick-witted enough to immediately hire adventurers upon returning to their nation, requesting them to help with the labyrinth conquest.

Rather, this is precisely why we should charge a high price for it. Adventurers that don’t have any pressing matters will choose to stay at an inn. However, there are probably people who are required to report back regularly. There are also people who would prefer to have at least one just in case anything unexpected happens while they’re in the labyrinth. With that in mind, our sales will surely increase along with the ‘Return Whistle’.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_377"><span class="indent">Seemed like <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> saw an opportunity for success and wanted to exploit it.

The difficulty of the labyrinth was lowered quite a bit.

Just as before, they ignored the tutorial missions and focused on progressing within the labyrinth instead. But, naturally, there was no way they could conquer the floors that easily.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_561"><span class="indent">Even so, those were the inflexible people who kept on challenging floors over and over.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_562"><span class="italic indent">I wonder what drove them to do so?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_563"><span class="italic indent">Could it be that they had employers? Or out of their pride perhaps?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_564"><span class="indent">The answers were never noble in any way. In fact, they were more practical reasons.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_565"><span class="indent">The day the Labyrinth was made public, Basson’s party found a rare-grade sword from the treasure chest. To them it was a most incredible weapon. It seemed that the competitors had a drastically different understanding of things compared to us.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_566"><span class="indent">Rare-grade equipment normally referred to an evolved version of a piece of quality equipment crafted with magisteel, after it experienced a long period of time, it eventually began to show special properties.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_567"><span class="indent">The magisteel produced in our nation used iron ores mined from the mountain region by the high orcs. They were exposed to the magicules unleashed by Veldora which prompted their change in quality. That’s why as soon as these ores were moved to the storage section of the labyrinth, their quality began to change naturally.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_568"><span class="indent">Not only was it easy to source, it was of very fine quality as well. And so, we generously used it as crafting material for equipment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_569"><span class="indent">Unlike the gear circulating the markets of the Western Nations, this equipment solely relied on magisteel to be crafted. Since they were different right down to the raw material, even the average gear in our nation’s garrison would appear to be special-grade to outsiders. Needless to say, it outperformed the challengers' equipment by several orders of magnitude.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_570"><span class="indent">As for the gear worn by the soldiers of our nation, they were crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples. There were around a dozen of them working at the workshop. Under <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s guidance, they were crafting equipment day in and day out. That’s why we got to produce gear in mass.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_571"><span class="indent">Even these weapons crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples were all superior in quality when compared to the average gear being sold on the markets of the Western Nations, even approaching the quality of special-grade.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_572"><span class="indent">These days, their creations were all put inside the treasure chests. The failed creations were destroyed and the ones that were deemed somewhat useful were placed in the treasure chests in the labyrinth. There was good gear and bad gear, but there was, nonetheless, outstanding work among them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_573"><span class="indent">One of them—a sword, barely making it to rare-grade, was taken by Basson.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_574"><span class="indent">The rate for getting one of them was one in a hundred. This probability seemed to be the sweet spot regarding the chance of winning the jackpot.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_575"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_576"><span class="indent">By the way, if it was crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, even his failed work would reach rare-grade. At first glance, you may think this was good stuff, but according to <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> himself, these failures were just failures.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_577"><span class="indent">“There is a distinct difference,” <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> declared.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_578"><span class="indent">So, I did some intense digging and, eventually, I uncovered some insights. While both pieces of equipment were of the same grading, each piece had a lot of variance in terms of their stats. <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could identify this and tell whether his work was a success or a failure.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_579"><span class="indent">In fact, I compared the sword forged by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciple and his own creation. Both were rare-grade, yet their differences were very obvious. It was thanks to the increase in precision of my ‘<span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ that I was able to realize the differences. Had <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> not pointed it out for me, I probably would not have known how to tell them apart.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_580"><span class="indent">To give an easy example, let’s say I copy a piece of equipment crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Obviously, the end product would be of the same grade. However, just like I’ve mentioned before, I could not recreate the quality. At first glance, the replica would appear to be the same as the original, but in truth, it was an inferior version of the original. This was the “difference”.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_581"><span class="indent">The reason for such a phenomenon to occur was probably because my blacksmithing technique was not as good as <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_582"><span class="indent">Therefore, I concluded that weapons had many different levels of quality. While even for weapon merchants, let alone amateurs, to tell such a difference, I started to understand how to differentiate good weapons from the bad.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_583"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_584"><span class="indent">To those whose lives relied on the quality of their weapons, the difference could be crucial.

There were even many people who wished to purchase his work. We were still considering that point, we planned to decide after doing some more market investigations.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_586"><span class="indent">The Level Boss on the tenth floor would drop rare-grade equipment—one of the best masterpieces crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples. While it was far from <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s work, it was still a high-grade item when compared to the average gear on the market.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_587"><span class="indent">Adventurers, naturally, would want better gear. No wonder Basson was so happy about it. After all, for an average grade weapon, as long as its quality was nice, its price would also be ten times higher than the average ones in the market. Moreover, for special-grade, I had been told that it could go as high as fifty times the market price.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_588"><span class="indent">As for rare-grade, it was all up to luck whether they could get it or not. It was rarely produced, and it wasn’t something you necessarily would be able to buy with money.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_589"><span class="indent">Obviously, there would be people who get obsessed with the labyrinth and try to come back for more.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_590"><span class="indent">Basson and his men were already promoting for us at the tavern.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_591"><span class="indent">“Hey hey, check this out, people! This is the sword that is worthy of my skills!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_592"><span class="indent">Just like that, Basson and his posse were bragging with his weapon at every opportunity.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_593"><span class="indent">The news that the tenth floor’s Level Boss would drop rare-grade equipment began to spread among the challengers. The news also began to reach the ears of the merchants as well as the members of the <span data-term="Freedom Association" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> across the continent.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_594"><span class="indent">We never expected all these people wishing to become rich overnight would flood our nation.

After all, those who weren’t willing to listen to our instructions, were always beaten by people who finished their tutorial missions before challenging the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_598"><span class="indent">Anyone with a bit of brain would know that the right thing to do was to listen to the instructions carefully first. Now, there were a lot more people who would do their tutorial mission seriously and receive their training on the first floor. The challengers were able to utilize the new knowledge they learned and apply it on the spot. There were also counters that sold various utility items, and this brought in a small fortune on its own.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_599"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_600"><span class="indent">Moreover—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_601"><span class="indent">A few days after our revamp of the labyrinth, there were teams that made their way to the fifth floor.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_602"><span class="indent">The second floor was merely very wide, and up until the fourth floor, most of the traps were just for show. They were not exactly malicious in any way. As long as you sketched maps of the passages, it was a piece of cake to reach the fifth floor.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_603"><span class="indent">That’s why it was a result that we expected.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_604"><span class="indent">From the fifth floor onward, it was up to the challengers’ abilities.

It was likely just because of their exhaustion. Having to be on guard against <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all the time would easily exhaust someone mentally.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_607"><span class="indent">Many people returned to the stairs temporarily to use the resting zone. The business of the inns on level ninety-five had been booming as well, which was exactly what we wanted.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_608"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_609"><span class="indent">Later, there were challengers that started making it to levels five through eight.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_610"><span class="indent">The adventurers from different nations’ <span data-term="Freedom Association" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branches had arrived as well. Among them were many skillful adventurers who were contracted by noblemen. The town had been bustling with life. People were discussing strategies with excitement.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_611"><span class="indent">Because of the second group of people joining the battle, the morale of people who fought first was raised as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_612"><span class="indent">It was then that some people began to cheat, ignoring proper rules of engagement and began to sell maps publicly within the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_613"><span class="indent">Some people were probably super bad with direction like I am. Something like the labyrinth couldn’t be conquered with strength alone, that’s why I understood why they wanted to cheat in this way, but… I hoped they would just find companions to team up and assign each other’s role appropriately together.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_614"><span class="indent">That’s why we were broadcasting, both inside and outside the labyrinth, that we would constantly change the internal layout. There were sad moans coming from the challengers all over the place, and many who just wouldn’t stop complaining about it. But I was the <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—I was in no way obligated to listen to their opinions.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_615"><span class="indent">I hoped to make them realize, sooner rather than later, that they wouldn’t be able to use maps not made by themselves. Essentially, if you didn’t make maps yourself, you would be unable to tackle the structural change of the labyrinth during your conquest. In a sense, this was a friendly reminder for them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_616"><span class="italic indent">I suppose this is what they call tough love.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_617"><span class="indent">The frequency of the layout changes was around once every two to three days.

It didn’t seem plausible that they’d make it to the checkpoint on the tenth floor without encountering a change.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_618"><span class="indent">That’s why the change in the layout of the labyrinth had many benefits. Challengers would start to strategize properly and give up on buying and selling maps. There would probably be people starting the conquest as soon as the layout change began and try to sketch and sell maps within the same day. Those people could do whatever they wanted.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_619"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_620"><span class="indent">We integrated this feature so as to prevent cheaters, and I was greatly satisfied with the result.

During the peak sessions of the labyrinth, it was so good as to make <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shout with joy. Moreover, the visitors to the town would all rest at the inns and use the services of the restaurants. I heard that business had been booming lately.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_745"><span class="indent">“Here are the reports,” <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said as he handed me some documents.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_746"><span class="indent">Veldora and Ramiris were interested as well, so I gave them each a copy. I had Raphael-san run the numbers in detail. This way I would make sure that the content was in order.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_747"><span class="italic indent">Let’s see now. </span><span class="indent">I glanced through the report.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_748"><span class="indent">Fortunately, I could turn into my humanoid figure in times like this. Even though I </span><span class="italic indent">could</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;still read documents in my slime form, in terms of efficiency in tackling work-related matters, the humanoid form was definitely much more convenient.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_749"><span class="indent">It seemed that after our renovation to the labyrinth, it had been running smoothly. It could be verified by the statistics in this report.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_750"><span class="indent">“Looks like our promotion has had a great effect.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_751"><span class="indent">“Yes sir!” <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded happily. “It’s been bustling with work every day.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_752"><span class="indent">I wasn’t sure if Veldora and Ramiris had a clue what they had in front of them, but they were staring at the report intently.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_753"><span class="indent">The content was mainly the recent financial details with some special matters documented as well. For instance, adventurer ID card details.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_754"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked for <span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s assistance so that we could check through adventurer ID cards to confirm permission to enter the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_755"><span class="indent">It was a type of magical card that also monitors the user’s health status. It was a very convenient tool that occasionally recorded their status. The way to use the card was just like the explanation I got from the association’s help desk, so the adventurers were all very familiar with it. Bodyguards and mercenaries who were not part of the guild were in the minority, so it was very easy to integrate the system into our labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_756"><span class="indent">The fee for entering the labyrinth was three silver coins.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_757"><span class="indent">The card production was handled entirely by the <span data-term="Freedom Association" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was meant to reduce the workload at our service window. Our nation would issue a simplified version of the card as well at a price of ten silver coins.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_758"><span class="indent">Most people had the card from the association, but occasionally there were people who would purchase the simplified cards. Considering the profits we reaped from that process, the entry fee for the labyrinth alone earned us a sizable income.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_759"><span class="indent">In addition, the report also mentioned the three items crafted by Ramiris.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_760"><span class="indent">The ‘<span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’—it was only given out for free the first time. The reason for providing a free sample was to allow people to experience the convenience of the product.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_761"><span class="indent">They would have to purchase it from the second time onward. The price was two silver coins, a very reasonable price. Because this ‘<span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ would heal all the severe wounds inflicted before death, and then revive the person. After much discussion, we came to the conclusion that we might as well give them this little bonus effect.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_762"><span class="indent">In addition, if someone were to enter the labyrinth again without wearing the ‘<span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’, we had to send a broadcast in order to get the attention of the person in question. Although they’d have to bear the responsibility, we still didn’t want lives to be lost out of negligence.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_763"><span class="indent">To facilitate purchasing them, we situated the revival point next to the counter. This way, the ‘<span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ became a necessity. It was selling like hotcakes—the best, in fact, among the three items.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_764"><span class="indent">The item ‘Return Whistle’ was limited to single-person usage. The benefit of it was that it could return the user to the outside instantly. It was a life-savor when you got lost. In essence, it was an item made for emergency usage. Its price was rather high, at a cost of thirty silver coins.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_765"><span class="indent">Those who tried to save some cash by buying a ‘<span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ instead of a ‘Return Whistle’ should reconsider their choices. After all, while you could return to the entrance after death in this way, you also had a chance to lose your equipment. Despite keeping your armor intact, any weapons that fell out of your hands would be left behind. No one in their right mind fought while holding on to their loot, they were more likely to lay that stuff on the hallway floor. Subsequently, those goodies wouldn’t be extracted, and, in a sense, it was a penalty for death.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_766"><span class="indent">There aren’t many people who risked returning by dying, that’s probably why the item sold that well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_767"><span class="indent">The sale of ‘Event Recording Globe’ was a lot worse than we expected. However, there was a history where a large amount of it was purchased. It cost one gold coin, an expensive price as it would convert to around a hundred thousand yen. It looked like some people had the foresight to purchase this expensive item in large quantities.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_768"><span class="indent">You could easily utilize death to return to the entrance by using this item. I’m guessing that some people may be very stubborn in challenging the Level Bosses, so it’d be very dangerous to give away these items cheaply. This was why we set the price this high.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_769"><span class="indent">Even with that being case, I still thought there would be demand for it. Upon reaching the deeper levels, the difficulty of the floors would increase drastically. Given that the checkpoint only appears every ten levels, it must give the challengers the impression of trying to reach heaven’s gate.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_770"><span class="indent">I always thought that it would one day become profitable, even if just a little. Some people would, surely, find it useful.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_771"><span class="indent">There were also other ideas, such as lending weapons and armor. But they didn’t seem to be profitable yet. This gear was prepared by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they were of excellent quality. The only people using this seemed to be the ones who lost their weapons during their last attempt. However, it was slowly gaining popularity. When the rumors surrounding the amazing quality of the weapons spread far and wide, surely, there would be more people renting them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_772"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_773"><span class="indent">Everything seemed to be going smoothly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_774"><span class="indent">However, even if we finally landed some success, we still couldn’t get careless. Times like these require even more caution.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_775"><span class="indent">The fastest progressing team had been doing well. So far no one had deserted. They were gradually delving into deeper floors.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_776"><span class="indent">Fortunately for us, they managed to inspire other challengers’ motivation. They would come back to the labyrinth even after failed attempts, and our sales had been going up because of it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_777"><span class="italic indent">We must maintain this flow.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_778"><span class="italic indent">“I want to challenge the labyrinth again”</span><span class="indent">—if we could get everyone to think that, it would be surprisingly easy to get over a thousand customers in one day.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_779"><span class="indent">“Well then, according to <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun’s report, we have been very successful.

Not really, it’s just that the healing potions are surprisingly expensive. High ranking adventurers may have the spare cash to use them sparingly, but most average men won’t bear to use them.

And the price had hindered the number of customers from growing any faster.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_821"><span class="indent">In our nation, a lower healing potion would cost four silver coins. While a higher healing potion was sold for thirty-five silver coins. And regarding full healing potions, we weren’t even selling them on the market. And even if we did, it would cost somewhere around five hundred silver coins to five gold coins, and more.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_822"><span class="indent">The cost of living in our nation’s cheapest inn, accounting solely for lodging, cost three silver coins. It cost five silver coins instead for included baths and a meal. Better inns, used mainly by merchants, cost around ten silver coins, excluding meals. This is the equivalent of a Rank D challenger’s entire day’s worth of work within the labyrinth. The average income was around fifteen silver coins. And even with a team to improve efficiency, it fell around twenty silver coins. This income was passable for now. It was sufficient to make a living with this money.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_823"><span class="indent">But it may not be the case for any emergency situations. For instance, them falling sick or being severely wounded. They had no chance to experience a complete social welfare system. In addition, it was also important to maintain their weapons and armor.

It may even become a specialty of our nation. When we have enough profit, we may even invest part of it on healthcare. Any sickness would be covered, and even if you were to be severely wounded, there could be solutions. It’ll be just like Japan.

That’s why we welcomed immigrants. But perhaps once our nation matured, we may even come down against immigration. The so-called nation, at its core, is just a massive mutual assistance organization. People can’t live on their own, that’s why they form communal groups to help each other out. That’s why we didn’t want any parasites in this nation.

That said, most people probably won’t drink unidentified potion anyway.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_853"><span class="indent">“Perhaps some people would. We can mix it with poison.

In this way, even if it really was trash, people would still value it a lot. I didn’t think we needed to put in too many big prizes.

It was the same cost as the labyrinth's entry fee, but for those who toiled away in continuous battles, it was a price they gladly paid. After all, most of the people who heard the pitch ended up using the service.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1073"><span class="indent">And there was a definite reason for that: The structure of the labyrinth was ever-changing. Once every two or three days the labyrinth shifted. This made any attempt at challenging the labyrinth far more difficult than it may have seemed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1074"><span class="indent">There were very few people who didn’t get lost within the vastness of the labyrinth, and there were countermeasures to prevent the ‘Spirit Communication’ of spirit-wielders.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1075"><span class="indent">Therefore, it became difficult to determine the shortest route. In other words, it was difficult to get to the tenth floor in just one day, forcing many to sleep within the labyrinth’s halls.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1076"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1077"><span class="indent">“Seriously, this is my first time camping out in the open.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1078"><span class="indent">“How’d it go?

This wasn’t only a problem among ‘Otherworlders’, but the locals had a tough time, too.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1084"><span class="indent">Even if you secured a room with a treasure chest and slept inside it, you would need someone to keep watch. There were also those who wandered the labyrinth without ever catching any sleep or taking a rest, so providing a place where they could relax and go to bed was highly appreciated, more than we had thought.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1085"><span class="indent">Also, it would’ve been a waste to dump the gear you had earned to the wayside. This was also part of the plan, because even if it looked like useless items, there was a chance that something good might’ve been mixed in.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1086"><span class="indent">Besides that, food and bedding for several days, replacements and maintenance supplies for gear—they had to bring these necessities, setting a limit on how many of the items they found they would be able to tote along.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1087"><span class="indent">When there was no more room to spare, the easiest thing to cut down on was food.

In those cases, there was a possibility you would lose your items, but that was apparently deemed preferable to starvation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1089"><span class="indent">This brought the spotlight back to the ‘Return Whistle’, raising discussions about its usefulness, and, because you could leave with all of your items in hand, there was a great surge in purchases lately.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1090"><span class="indent">In that way, to maximize the number of items you could take, reducing the amount of food had become mainstream.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1091"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1092"><span class="indent">What if, in that situation, there was an inn that could be used inside the labyrinth?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1093"><span class="indent">Merely returning to the stairs was all it took to reach the inn. Doing so, made it redundant to carry food and bedding, allowing you to travel lightly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1094"><span class="indent">If there was an inn available, it was only natural to use it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1095"><span class="indent">A safe resting place was available for three silver coins—the same amount as the labyrinth’s entry fee. That was triple the price of those on the surface, so it was a tad expensive, but you were also offered food. And so, with three silver in your pocket, you could use the inn and stay for a night.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1096"><span class="indent">The building was divided up between male and female and offered only tiny areas with nothing more than a bed like in a capsule hotel.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1097"><span class="indent">To be honest, the service wasn’t as good as above ground.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1098"><span class="indent">The management of this place was left to the treants, and they used it as a place to train new employees. Cleaning, laundry, cooking and serving the customers. They let the inexperienced trainees get their practice here, and if they passed, they would then be allowed to work on the surface.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1099"><span class="indent">Nevertheless, the people who used it would still use it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1100"><span class="indent">You could buy safety in exchange for money, so this was no time to complain. Also, there were fancy additional services available for those who could afford it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1101"><span class="indent">Laundry wash: three silver coins.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1102"><span class="indent">Public bath usage: three silver coins.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1103"><span class="indent">Gear cleaning and repair: five silver coins.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1104"><span class="indent">These were our pricey, exclusive services, and yet, there was a surprising number of customers using them. Constantly fighting in the labyrinth meant you’d inevitably be soaked in blood and sweat. Women, in particular, were bothered by the smell, so baths were greatly welcomed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1105"><span class="indent">For that reason, we raked in a lot more revenue inside the labyrinth than above ground, and the profit margins were excessively higher to boot.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1106"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1107"><span class="indent">Even if you didn’t use it as an inn, there were times when you just needed a place to take a break, and being able to safely use the bathroom without worry seemed to have been a major selling point.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1108"><span class="indent">After having it pointed out by <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and digging a little deeper, this seemed to have been giving everyone a hard time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1109"><span class="indent">There were no bathrooms in the labyrinth. When side by side with death, you had to muster the determination to just let it leak if need be.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1110"><span class="indent">There was no need to clean up, either, since the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that spawned would take care of it on their own.

Thanks to that, we didn’t need to worry about cleaning up after anyone. Besides, every time the structure of the labyrinth shifted, the unnecessary trash was eliminated. And so, surprisingly, the labyrinth was always kept clean and tidy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1112"><span class="indent">Yet in spite of all that, the issue regarding toilets remained.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1113"><span class="indent">From the labyrinth management's perspective, having the whole place stink was a ‘shitty’ situation. But as if that wasn’t bad enough, the challengers had another problem to deal with: getting attacked by a <span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> at your most defenseless state of times, that would likely drive anyone to tears. You could shout “Time out!” all you wanted, but the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> held themselves to no such courtesies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1114"><span class="indent">For both numbers one and two, you’d always need someone keeping watch.

At worst, I’d bet some would rather choose death in those instances.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1119"><span class="indent">Mixed parties of men and women weren’t uncommon either, so it was no surprise that the inns would see a lot of visitors, considering the toilet situation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1120"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1121"><span class="indent">Incidentally, there were those who took care of it with the help of some magic. They said that they managed their condition with the use of daily magic ‘Health Care’ or ‘Clean Wash’ within the labyrinth. ‘Health Care’ was said to help you manage your bowel movements. Although there was a limit, I heard that they could hold it for about three days with no problem.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1122"><span class="indent">For everyone who didn’t fancy wetting themselves during battle, this was said to be an essential spell. Nonetheless, one would be remiss to forget about its limit.

We spent this time getting used to the avatars, and thus we began our training.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1999"><span class="indent">We did things like fighting <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the upper levels or attacking newcomers who seemed like actual adventurers. During these few days, we began to assign roles and were getting pretty good at it. But before we had reached that level of teamwork, we took plenty of beatings.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2000"><span class="indent">We were even losing to beginner teams on the upper floors. There were times when we were taken out by our own traps set in the labyrinth. Those were some awkward moments. That did really piss me off though, leading to the development of magic items that would prevent the labyrinth traps from getting triggered by us. However, the times we did fall to these traps would remain as fond memories.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2001"><span class="indent">Ramiris fell into a trap, getting Veldora tangled up in it as well. I floated into the air while Milim got pushed against the ceiling. Since I didn’t have to worry about getting caught in traps, I had gotten careless and forgot to alert them. It was a huge misstep, but, speaking of which, Ramiris… </span><span class="italic indent">How did you end up falling into a trap?</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;I could feel everyone relentlessly teasing her about it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2002"><span class="indent">And so, as we endured, we trained all day and night without even catching a wink of sleep.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2003"><span class="indent">In combat, the most important thing was coordination. Under normal circumstances, we would’ve been able to call out to each other or give signals with a glance. However, we didn’t have neat tricks like that. Mostly because Veldora and Milim were both tryhards.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2004"><span class="indent">However, I did have a Skill that was basically like cheating. I could use ‘Telepathy Net’ to contact everyone and deliver them precise commands. With myself as the command post, Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris were my foot soldiers. And in that way, we drastically increased our strength and raised our standards.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2005"><span class="indent">Once we could move with a certain level of confidence, we began to review our teamwork. Days passed as we waited for the equipment to be finished.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2006"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2007"><span class="indent">It was then that we were informed about ‘<span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ managing to break through level forty.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2008"><span class="indent">“This is bad.

A ghost could wear equipment as well, it was a specific property of magical gear.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2036"><span class="indent">Veldora’s got the Grim Reaper’s bastard sword and full body armor of hell. His left hand was equipped with the great shield of hell’s gate. He was fully geared up.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2037"><span class="indent">As for Milim who was playing a slime, she could only be equipped with simple things. She first swallowed the Grim Reaper’s <span data-term="javelin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and wore a crimson feathered cape. She immediately gained a pair of red wings after equipping it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2038"><span class="italic indent">That’s some incredible change.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2039"><span class="indent">“The gear has to be equipped or it won't activate the effect!” Milim said with glee.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2040"><span class="indent">Since she was happy, I had no room to say anything.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2041"><span class="indent">Ramiris was next. She asked for heavy full body armor from <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The armor itself was finely crafted, the problem was whether or not she could wear it. Ramiris anxiously transferred herself to her avatar and tried to put on the armor. At that moment, lo and behold, the armor had been swapped out. With a loud ‘Clang’, the rubbish armor fell to the ground and turned into dust before being blown away by the wind.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2042"><span class="indent">Ramiris’s animated armor became heavy animated armor. This was not an evolution, and it also didn’t seem to be a change in equipment. Instead, the pieces of armor themselves swapped their places.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2043"><span class="indent">“Eh, I move so swiftly now!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2044"><span class="indent">Just as Ramiris said, before this her movement was very unnatural, like she needed to be lubricated. Now her movement looked very smooth. This would, surely, make coordination much smoother with her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2045"><span class="indent">I never expected the quality of the armor to have an effect on movement. What an unexpected discovery.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2046"><span class="indent">Seeing how happy Ramiris looked, I asked her to choose her weapons and shield.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2047"><span class="indent">“Pooh! Stuff like shields are unnecessary for me!” saying that, she chose a large two-handed weapon, the Grim Reaper’s great axe.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2048"><span class="indent">Its sheer might makes it a top-notch weapon, though wielding it may prove difficult. But never mind that, this would do. She always got mocked for being weak, so she probably got a little carried away this time. Interestingly, it reflected her personality as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2049"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2050"><span class="indent">And so, everyone changed to their new equipment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2051"><span class="indent">This equipment fell under unique-grade. Since they were adjusted to be equipped by <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, their designs, however, were rather unbalanced and comical in nature. Still, for any amateur adventurers, this was incredibly strong gear. We also applied some sort of a curse to register their users, so that they couldn’t be stolen. To us right now, these were the best gear out there.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2052"><span class="indent">This new switch restored our resolve. Before we embarked on our battle, our spirits were soaring.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2053"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2054"><span class="indent">We checked the status of our avatars.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2055"><span class="indent">My ghost had given up physical attacks and focused on magic and mental attacks. It served the role of a sorcerer. I hoped to learn about ‘Spirit Magic’ and ‘Illusion Magic’ soon, since my goal was to become a wizard. Aside from that, I also wanted to learn ‘Holy Magic’. What would happen if I placed my faith in myself? That was kind of part of my experiment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2056"><span class="indent">Veldora’s skeleton swordsman was a Jack of all trades, he could do anything. He served the role of a heavy warrior, but seemed to want to learn magic and become a magic knight.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2057"><span class="indent">Milim’s slime, on the other hand, specialized in speed and one-shot-kills. She’s the super buffed type. Or perhaps I should call her the romantic type?</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;TL note: I believe Romantic Type (" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">&nbsp;It was her job to be the assassin.

If the enemies fell for it, she’d look like a boss. But what would she do if the enemies saw through such a setup? Well, I think she would run away, considering her high mobility. In some ways, slime was the perfect form for this.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2059"><span class="indent">Ramiris’s heavy animated armor focused on strong attacks. It possessed some level of defense and even had the potential to be quite balanced. She fit the role of berserker. Not that she had really gone berserk, but it seemed that she has never considered her defensive capabilities. That was just how I had been calling her since she decided to become a dangerous <span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bent on attacking.

Bound by my mana pool, I could not use all the magic, but my vast arcane knowledge remained. Compared to a third-rate court mage, my magic was still leagues ahead. I didn’t need to chant my spells and could cast consecutively without delay. Surely our enemy couldn’t handle that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2072"><span class="indent">As for Veldora, I almost suspected that he had a pair of eyes in the back of his head. He swung his sword like a master of swordsmanship.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2073"><span class="indent">“GAHAHAHA! My ‘Veldora-Style Killing Arts</span><span class="indent">TM</span><span class="indent">’ incorporates countless sword techniques.

And I thought that mangas were just making up the drawings, looks like there were actually practical techniques out there as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2075"><span class="indent">Veldora was pretty unpredictable to begin with, so nothing could really surprise me at this point. Looking at him closely enough, you would realize he was acting like a moron.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2076"><span class="indent">On the other hand, we had Milim. She wasn’t lying when she said that she focused on speed. She zipped around at break-neck speeds. It was beyond what the average person could control, let alone replicate, yet with Milim’s reflexes, it was a piece of cake. Actually, I should say that that’s just how fast a slime could move when it got serious. She could ignore friction while sliding across the ground and closed in on the enemies with a bounce. The way she darted along the ceiling with the same speed, surely, made it close to impossible for your everyday adventurer to spot her clearly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2077"><span class="indent">I was a slime as well, yet I’d never realized such a thing until now. I was profoundly shocked.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2078"><span class="indent">“WAHAHAHA! You are so slow, all so slow. Eat this, you dimwit!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2079"><span class="indent">Milim snuck behind her enemy without making a sound, acting all smug about it, and impaled the enemy’s neck with her Grim Reaper’s <span data-term="javelin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—most fights with her ended like that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2080"><span class="indent">Physical attacks couldn’t easily harm her, and in order to cast magic against her, you would first need to get a clear fix on her. Now that I thought about this, it was pretty terrifying to fight Milim’s slime as your opponent.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2081"><span class="indent">The person to complement Veldora and Milim was Ramiris, the ‘Professional Wingman’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2082"><span class="indent">“WHOOOA! LET ME SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2083"><span class="indent">She led the charge as soon as we saw enemies. In addition, Ramiris’s combat style was to fight people head-on. Under normal circumstances, this was a risky move that rarely acted in her favor. She’s such an idiot. But for the rest of us, her doing so was the right tactic. After reminding her several times to no avail, we turned this in our favor. In short, we used Ramiris as bait while we launched a three-pronged attack.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2084"><span class="indent">Normally, it would’ve been tricky to pull this off. But Ramiris set loose on a blind rampage, utterly disregarding defense. All the enemies saw was a large set of armor wielding the Grim Reaper’s great axe barreling towards them. By then, confronting it was inevitable.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2085"><span class="indent">Because she completely neglected defense, all of their attacks were focused on Ramiris. However, she had ‘<span data-term="Pain Nullification" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’, that’s why she didn’t even flinch and launched attacks one after another.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2086"><span class="indent">In addition, the armor itself was very sturdy. Sparing no cost and paying no mind to weight, the heavy animated armor was crafted out of thick sheets of magisteel.

The main reason was due to growth in the scale of economies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2136"><span class="indent">In addition, the value of currency also changed. Currencies were once made of valuable metals such as gold and silver to ensure its value. However, in the new age, physical currencies were replaced by certificates and documents during trade.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2137"><span class="indent">That was the birth of the paper money economy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2138"><span class="indent">And so, a mechanism required for the money to flow was born—the banking system. You would receive receipts by storing your gold coins in a bank, and in return, you could exchange those receipts for the physical, material currency. The banks could utilize the money stored in them at will; thus, they came up with a different mode of business: loaning money to those in need and turning a profit by setting interest rates.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2139"><span class="indent">This was a sorcery worse than alchemy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2140"><span class="indent">Primarily, there was no money there, and yet, interest was accruing. On one hand was the total amount of physical money circulating in the market, and on the other was the total amount of receipts. When comparing the two, there would always be a certain unrecoverable difference… Someone would eventually have to pay the price for being unable to cover this fabricated margin.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2141"><span class="indent">This fundamental issue was inherent to the system of lending money and receiving interest.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2142"><span class="indent">Such a phenomenon became even worse when physical currencies were replaced by paper money. People would ask for loans from rich people with the interest rate as bait. Afterward, they would use the money to invest in financial products—to use money to make money. This cycle would continue beyond national boundaries and into the entire world.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2143"><span class="indent">Guaranteed in the name of the state, cash would be printed without limits. Meanwhile, the relative differences in national power would be exploited to manipulate the exchange rate and expand the scale of the economy to a dozen times its previous size.

You were too careless, idiot!” Milim shouted gleefully.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2338"><span class="indent">At the sound of Milim’s delighted voice, the remaining five men tensed up. They huddled together, staying on guard, but to no avail.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2339"><span class="indent">“Blazing wind, turn into a whirling tornado and cut through your enemies! Blow, Tornado Blade!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2340"><span class="indent">It was a mistake to have bunched together. As if laughing at those cautious foes, the Tornado Blade I unleashed cut right into them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2341"><span class="indent">Tornado Blade was an area magic version of Wind Cutter. It cost a couple more magicules, but it could be used to attack multiple enemies in a specific area. It was great for taking on a full squad of enemies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2342"><span class="indent">Milim ambushed the people in charge of checking traps as they were walking at the front. After quickly injuring her opponents, she had left the scene before I cast the magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2343"><span class="indent">The people to the rear of the squad had no clue what even happened. But as they became alerted, I followed up the attack with the Wind Cutter. It didn’t affect Milim, and my magic took out the entire enemy squad.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2344"><span class="indent">“Shit, it’s the Crimson Comet! Everyone, watch out!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2345"><span class="indent">“Sonuvabitch, Majya and Najya have been taken out by the magic. Jean also stopped breathing!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2346"><span class="indent">“Bastards! You whoresons! How dare you kill them!?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2347"><span class="indent">The enemies roared in rage upon realizing what was going on. They were, in other words, the challengers of the labyrinth. It looked like a relatively balanced group of adventurers this time. However, our experience and strength were both far superior to them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2348"><span class="indent">We took the initiative and took out the explorers within the enemy team. In order to make use of their being unaware of our presence, we made a preemptive attack using anti-group magic. Before discovering the enemy team, we would operate with invisibility magic applied. We would always see them coming first.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2349"><span class="indent">Once we attacked, the invisibility spell would deactivate, but by that time, we would have downed at least one or two men. They were usually the mage or healer at the back of the team, providing support. At this point, it's like the game had already been decided.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2350"><span class="indent">As we came out of our invisibility spell, the enraged vanguards quickly discovered us and charged.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2351"><span class="indent">“GAHAHAHA! YOU ARE ALL TOO NAIVE!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2352"><span class="indent">“WO—HEHEHE! DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT LEAVING THIS PLACE!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2353"><span class="indent">Veldora and Ramiris, fully immersed in their roles, handled the assault.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2354"><span class="indent">Since there was no need for me to show up, I decided to hang back and just provide aid for the two of them. I also used analysis magic to investigate the warriors charging at us. There were red health bars above all of their heads which had dropped below half at that point.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2355"><span class="indent">“These people have less than half of their HP. Surely, you two would be enough to handle these guys?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2356"><span class="indent">It wasn’t that I was getting ahead of myself, just confirming the state of our enemies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2357"><span class="indent">Indeed, the red bar above the warriors’ heads indicated their hit points. Only I could see it due to the analysis magic. To make everything clearer, I made it so that it would look like something that would be in a video game. Even if other people used the same type of magic, they would probably see it differently.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2358"><span class="indent">That aside, it was convenient enough for me to use. Seeing things being expressed in a familiar manner, I was able to quickly identify the situation and give the appropriate commands.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2359"><span class="indent">Considering how things had developed, we had this one in the bag.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2360"><span class="indent">Without the supporting aid from the back, the vanguard didn’t stand a chance against Veldora and Ramiris. They had no defensive buffs, spell or healing. With their HP decreased, they had no chance.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2361"><span class="indent">If this were a more cautious team, they would have had a ‘Barrier’ set up at all times… But it seemed that the team wasn’t really that type.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2362"><span class="indent">And so, Veldora and Ramiris happily slayed the three remaining foes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2363"><span class="indent">It was an easy win.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2364"><span class="indent">With Milim’s sneak attack on top of my magic, we were able to take out the scout and the rear guards—and that was our “gg ez” strategy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2365"><span class="indent">However, we’d been picking too many fights lately, and it was inefficient. Even though the challengers’ strategies hadn’t been perfected, there were certainly more people thinking about them. The labyrinth challengers weren’t stupid. They were trying hard every day to improve as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2366"><span class="indent">While that was certainly pleasant to hear, we also had to reconsider our engagement strategy with them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2367"><span class="indent">—As I thought so, the last man in front of us disappeared, fading away in beams of light.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2368"><span class="indent">The battle was over.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2369"><span class="indent">I’d seen this scene a million times at this point.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2370"><span class="indent">“Amazing!

WE ARE THE STRONGEST, THE INVINCIBLE!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2372"><span class="indent">“GAHAHAHA! THOSE ROOKIES WEREN’T EVEN ENOUGH AS MY APPETIZERS.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2373"><span class="indent">My companions had gotten smug enough to brag about their achievement.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2374"><span class="indent">Indeed, we four made up the team.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2375"><span class="indent">—Eh, you want to know what we were up to all this time?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2376"><span class="indent">That goes without saying. We were using labyrinth challengers as the test subjects for our strategies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2377"><span class="indent">We all loved learning and had been studying tirelessly every, single, day.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2378"><span class="indent">………</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2379"><span class="indent">……</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2380"><span class="indent">…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2381"><span class="indent">Umm, but what about the whole ‘<span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ deal from last time?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2382"><span class="indent">It had been a great win, but we weren’t satisfied just yet. We hadn’t seen the team ‘<span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ ever since, either. They were apparently called back by their home nation, possibly never to return.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2383"><span class="indent">With that being said, it might also have been because they had difficulty obtaining new gear for new levels. I was not sure whether they would return one day or not, but we had to get ready to fight them, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2384"><span class="indent">That’s why, even if we had defeated ‘<span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’, we were going to keep roaming the labyrinth in secret to fight off challengers. In addition, another reason was the increased popularity of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2385"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2386"><span class="indent">Several days had passed after our fight to the death with the ‘<span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’. <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party managed to break through level forty.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2387"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the real lucky star as he managed to collect the <span data-term="ogre" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weapon series. With it, they successfully defeated the tempest serpent, and now they aimed to challenge level fifty. With <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party making it beyond level forty, the other challengers became much more motivated. And as we’d hoped, many capable individuals set their sights on level forty.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2388"><span class="indent">We publicized the video footage of the Level Boss fight as a test and it was received very well. We used the video projector to record the fight between <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s team and the tempest serpent. It became a hot topic even within the town as people kept on requesting to replay the clip.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2389"><span class="indent">There was money to be made with this—<span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I thought to ourselves. There was no television in this world, so the battle footage within the labyrinth was considered to be top tier entertainment. But, obviously, considering the potentially gruesome scenes that would be showcased, we considered editing the footage beforehand.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2390"><span class="indent">However, some people seemed to prefer the uncut version. Therefore, there was some room reserved for negotiation in that regard—mainly depending on how much the people asking would pay.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2391"><span class="indent">There were also issues regarding the broadcasting rights, portrait rights, etc. All of the cumbersome formalities were handed to <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2392"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s smile could probably be its own merchandise. That patented smile alone would earn us a sweet sum of money. In that way, <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would get some benefit, and <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I would also be counting cash. Apart from learning from the mistakes, we were also looking forward to the future development of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2393"><span class="indent">The video footage was not limited to the video directly recorded by the magic item. We had actually saved a lot of things. Raphael-san also extracted a large amount of data from the labyrinth. By conducting “<span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” on it, it was possible to recreate the images. We also made video compilations of cool performances by the challengers and broadcasted them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2394"><span class="indent">They turned out to be a big hit. Some people were even saying “Thanks to this footage, I got to have a girlfriend!” Many people who wanted to become famous were tempted to give it a try. Even people who weren’t serious before, began to put in some hard work.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2395"><span class="indent">I mean, I knew the feeling.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2396"><span class="indent">Even though it might be cruel to say this, at least they put in more effort. But in front of them was a high wall called reality. Don’t be too idealistic just yet! On the notion of giving tough love to our contestants, </span><span class="italic indent">we </span><span class="indent">began to interfere with the challengers’ progress.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2397"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2398"><span class="indent">Nowadays we were called the ‘Dungeon Dominators’</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Kanji reads “Reapers of the labyrinth”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">, feared by all.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2399"><span class="indent">Our appearance also had some drastic changes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2400"><span class="indent">The ghost controlled by me now had <span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> surrounding it, engulfed in blue and white flames—a Fire Aura. I found this to be a very stylish look for me.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2401"><span class="indent">As for Veldora’s skeleton swordsman, all of his bones were renewed. Seeing how Ramiris’s armor changed, Veldora wanted to renew his bones as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2402"><span class="indent">I asked him what he wanted, and he responded rather recklessly, that “A gold skull suits me better.” I was just going to ignore his request at first. But since I also had <span data-term="Diablo" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s request to handle, I tried to change my perspective on the matter and thought that I could use Veldora as an experiment for temporary flesh replacement. I wanted to test the metallic skeleton body’s abilities, so I decided to exchange that with Veldora’s avatar.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2403"><span class="indent">Ordinary gold wasn’t very strong. That was why I decided to utilize the strongest material I had available instead, though it was still in the experimental phase.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2404"><span class="indent">It happened to be golden as well, so I decided to go ahead with it. It was called ‘orichalcum’</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Orichalcum or aurichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, including the story of Atlantis in the Critias of Plato." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">, a special alloy refined from a mixture of magisteel and gold, while also infused with an unusually dense concentration of magicules. I wanted to combine the immutability of gold on top of the traits of magisteel.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2405"><span class="indent">The result was very successful, not just in terms of strength. The overall performance of orichalcum exceeded magisteel; it was an incredible metal. And so, orichalcum was born.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2406"><span class="indent">The problem with it, however, was the difficulty of its production. Gold itself was already rare and could not be produced en masse.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2407"><span class="indent">However, this time I humored Veldora’s request. Which was why I spent a hefty sum of money making the orichalcum and fabricating the humanoid skeleton.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2408"><span class="indent">As with Ramiris’ outfit, all we needed was a ‘Master Core’, since it didn’t matter what type of skeleton we had installed for Veldora. And in the blink of an eye, the golden skeleton swordsman was born in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2409"><span class="indent">His bones were insanely strong, nothing like his previous skeleton.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2410"><span class="indent">I closely observed Veldora’s skeleton swordsman to examine its durability, as well as any potential flaws.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2411"><span class="indent">Milim’s reputation, on the other hand, was even more far-reaching. People were all afraid of the infamous ‘Crimson Comet’. With her abnormal speed, her afterimage looked like a red comet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2412"><span class="indent">She abandoned all her techniques besides speed and focused on landing critical hits to achieve victory. This fighting style instilled fear and made her a legend.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2413"><span class="indent">Ramiris’s style also changed slowly. She became the brawn type and had been giving off an ominous energy around her. She glowed with purple flames—her heavy animated armor was enveloped in an aura of death.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2414"><span class="indent">She would wield her Grim Reaper’s great axe to crush her enemy and never backed down from a fight. This ended up giving her the reputation of the crazed heavy animated armor.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2415"><span class="indent">Her avatar might be stronger than her… No, never mind.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2416"><span class="indent">For the sake of Ramiris’s own reputation, it was best to let matters lie.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2417"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2418"><span class="indent">And so, in a span of a few days, we all became famous.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2419"><span class="indent">The challengers’ response was pretty good as well. They all seemed to be afraid of us and kept their guard up against us. We were stronger than most low-level bosses, and also much meaner.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2420"><span class="indent">It was only natural for the challengers to react this way.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2421"><span class="indent">As I said before, our primary objective was to study how to fight within the labyrinth. We definitely weren’t just messing around for fun. You MUST not confuse that. We had been working hard every day and diving into our research. Surely, with the hard work that we’d put in, it would be useful someday.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2422"><span class="indent">In fact, we had seen many challengers using rare Extra Skills as well as seemingly original magic spells. We had learned a lot from it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2423"><span class="indent">Nowadays, Raphael-san could extract intelligence from the labyrinth directly, using ‘<span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’, and so the labyrinth had become a vault of information.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2424"><span class="indent">In addition, just as our own techniques would be reflected on the avatars, the things we learned via the avatars would also come back to our original bodies. This was an unexpected outcome, but was quickly considered as a new way to train.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2425"><span class="indent">And so, we performed our research every day.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2426"><span class="indent">Naturally, we made an ample amount of new discoveries.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2427"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2428"><span class="indent">There was one time that we got a bit too arrogant and decided to challenge the entire labyrinth with our team.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2429"><span class="indent">We quickly met our disastrous defeat.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2430"><span class="indent">With our abilities alone, we could not even get past the Level Boss on the fiftieth floor—<span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We couldn’t hold a candle to opponents above Rank A if we were to fight fairly. And even if we were to sneak attack, it wouldn’t have worked on <span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

Its size was about the same as the first gate. Only this time, the door seemed to have been enchanted with some sort of spell.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4774"><span class="indent">“—I see. This appears to have been enchanted with an ancient magic defense mechanism. If you accidentally disturb this contraption, the defensive mechanisms within the city may activate.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4775"><span class="indent">“Defensive mechanisms? Are they still functioning?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4776"><span class="indent">“Yes, please be very careful. If we were to trigger it accidentally, we may no longer be able to investigate the ruins,” Kagali-san advised everyone with a serious face. The team also seemed rather tense upon hearing her words.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4777"><span class="indent">I was more curious about how Clayman opened this gate.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4778"><span class="indent">“Is Clayman connected to these ruins in any way?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4779"><span class="indent">“That guy only rose to power recently; he shouldn’t have anything to do with such ancient ruins.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4780"><span class="indent">“Perhaps he was able to decode the sorcery and open the door with the correct procedure.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4781"><span class="indent">Hmm-hmm.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4782"><span class="indent">That’s right, even if it were Clayman, surely, he would’ve been able to undo the sorcery with enough time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4783"><span class="italic indent">By the way, I recall that Clayman had a Unique Skill as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4784"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Correct. He possessed Unique Skill ‘Puppeteer’; he could receive or transmit information in encoded signals.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4785"><span class="italic indent">Yeah yeah yeah, that’s it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4786"><span class="indent">It was some ability about analyzing intelligence, surely, it would be just as simple to analyze magic spells.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4787"><span class="italic indent">By the way, did I obtain the Skill as well?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4788"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Answer. It is an inferior version of master’s Skill; thus, it has been decomposed into energy and absorbed. If anything, the Skill ‘Ley Line Manipulation’ has been added to ‘<span data-term="Law Manipulation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4789"><span class="italic indent">I see, no wonder it didn’t report it to me.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4790"><span class="indent">Because it wasn’t worth mentioning. That’s why Raphael-san never brought it up. But if Clayman could do it, so could I. Even though this would be Raphael-san doing all the actual work.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4791"><span class="indent">“We may be stuck figuring this thing out for a long time.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4792"><span class="indent">“We ran headfirst into a mighty challenging task. But our circumstances are already a lot better than what we’ve done in the past. Let’s calm down and analyze it carefully!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4793"><span class="indent">The members of the exploration team talked amongst themselves in a display of motivation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4794"><span class="indent">Ignoring them all, I put my hand on the gate. I instantly got a picture of the energy coming from the ‘ley lines’ permeating the wall in the form of magic spells.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4795"><span class="indent">“I get it now. If we were to destroy this door, the lights on this level would all vanish. All of the energy would be used to repel the invaders before reconstructing itself. It’s still functioning normally even after more than a thousand years. Looks like this is a super advanced product born from the magic-wielding civilization.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4796"><span class="indent">It was all Greek to me, but thanks to the help of the all-talented Raphael-san, I was able to unravel the matter easily. It was like playing a puzzle game, making it somewhat intriguing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4797"><span class="indent">Like solving an arithmetic problem. I undid the magic expressions one by one and finally found the way to open the gate.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4798"><span class="indent">“Ah, there you go. By channeling magic here, we should be able to open the input window of the coded spell.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4799"><span class="indent">I finished my sentence only to turn around and see the expedition team with their mouths hanging open.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4800"><span class="italic indent">Oh snap, I overdid that a bit</span><span class="indent">—I suddenly realized.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4801"><span class="indent">I accidentally started analyzing due to it being so interesting. This was supposed to be their job.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4802"><span class="indent">“Sorry, I got ahead of myself…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4803"><span class="indent">“I-it’s alright, don’t worry about it,” Kagali-san said to comfort me, but I still felt that I owed an apology to everyone.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4804"><span class="indent">I reflected upon what I’d done while petting Ranga as I patiently waited.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4805"><span class="indent">—That’s what I should have done. But my own teammates couldn’t contain themselves.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4806"><span class="indent">“WAHAHAHA! I want to solve it as well!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4807"><span class="indent">“I give up.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4808"><span class="indent">Milim started shouting loudly, prancing before the gate, while <span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t figure out a thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4809"><span class="indent">That seemed to cheer up the other teammates and they began to discuss. The spark to drive the situation was the question Kagali-san asked, “<span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, could I ask you about something? How did you analyze the puzzle?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4810"><span class="indent">By then I was stroking Ranga’s fur. But since she’d asked, I couldn’t very well withhold an answer. To quench her thirst for clarification, I explained the analysis method in detail.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4811"><span class="indent">“First, we need to investigate what sort of magical expressions were used before it came to be, then we could sort those expressions into different stages.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4812"><span class="indent">“Do you mean to identify the most recently used magical expression?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4813"><span class="indent">“Right, we then probe what should be removed from the end-product to prevent that magical expression from activating. Repeat this process for the expression before it and so on until you grasp the foundation—that is the underlying flow, the nucleus, of this mechanism. Then, after that, it will conversely give you only the right answers.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4814"><span class="indent">“I see…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4815"><span class="indent">“Ruling out false leads and only preserving the expressions that are functioning correctly, is it?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4816"><span class="indent">No wonder why everyone present here was an elite, they immediately understood the method merely from listening to my short suggestion.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4817"><span class="indent">“Aren’t trap-type expressions complete on their own in many cases? They are like branches and leaves of a large tree that grow close together, parts that do not belong to the central roots and the trunk. This is, assuming that the expressions are not primarily intended to trigger the trap.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4818"><span class="indent">“…I see. So even if it’s the main stem of the expressions, we still shouldn’t let our guard down.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4819"><span class="indent">My teaching style seemed to be easy to understand, maybe because I had experience teaching kids. I was pleased to see that it was pretty well received, so I continued to demonstrate more and more of the puzzle analysis.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4820"><span class="indent">During this time, Milim opened the gate almost immediately. Later on, a couple of our teammates managed to open the door successfully as well. It was then that the chief called us.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4821"><span class="indent">“Everyone, we have prepared meals. You must be tired after your arduous journey; shall we call it a day?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4822"><span class="indent">Having it pointed out, I realized it was already evening.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4823"><span class="indent">She had a point, we could begin our exploration officially tomorrow. We would open the gate tomorrow and close up shop for now.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4824"><span class="indent">“Shall we stop for the day?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4825"><span class="indent">“I concur. Her saying that we’ve been on ‘an arduous journey’ still feels bizarre, nonetheless. We shall begin the investigation officially tomorrow.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4826"><span class="indent">With Kagali-san’s consent, the day came to a close.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4827"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

There were candlesticks on the stone walls emitting faint light that couldn’t be extinguished. This was some fantastic magic technology. But they were not actual candles, rather, illumination created by magic.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4836"><span class="indent">While feeling impressed, I walked towards the floor as Milim came to my side.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4837"><span class="indent">“I feel like there’s suddenly a really strong sense of oppression here.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4838"><span class="indent">“It’s true.

It tasted like mayonnaise and could even turn crumbly bread soft. And for people who still thought the bread was too tough, they could drink the warm vegetable soup from a large wooden bowl. The stock seemed to have been finely drawn from chicken bones, and it had a rich, savory taste. The vegetables had also thoroughly absorbed the fragrant aroma, and drinking it felt delightfully satisfying.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4872"><span class="indent">“No need to hold back, there’s more soup for everyone!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4873"><span class="indent">As I finished, some teammates rushed over with their bowls.

That’s why I had someone prepare bento.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4882"><span class="indent">Also, people would probably need to visit the toilet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4883"><span class="indent">“Ah, I had suspected people would probably want to use the toilet.

Everyone, please use the lunch break period to relieve yourself.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4884"><span class="indent">I quickly opened the ‘Portal’ after saying so.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4885"><span class="indent">I received a round of baffled stares shouting, “This is insane”. But I couldn’t just compromise because of that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4886"><span class="indent">Seriously, I was sure they were planning to sneak off in the darker parts of the passageways and get their business done, but I didn’t wish them to do so. After all, this was the road leading to a tomb, such sacrilege would just be too much.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4887"><span class="indent">“Maybe I’m overthinking it, perhaps the deceased won’t mind it after all.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4888"><span class="indent">“…No, your way of thinking is admirable,” Kagali-san agreed, which I was pleased to hear as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4889"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4890"><span class="indent">Right, as everyone went to take a toilet break—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4891"><span class="indent">“I want to try something, is it okay?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4892"><span class="indent">“Try what? Please do tell.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4893"><span class="indent">“Nothing significant, but we are actually running a labyrinth, and right now the most popular strategy has been ‘Spirit Communication’. It’s a spell that only a shaman or <span data-term="spirit wielder" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can use, it allows you to find your desired path right away.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4894"><span class="indent">“I-is there really magic that convenient?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4895"><span class="indent">Oh, so even Kagali-san didn’t know. Actually, it was probably normal that she didn’t know anything outside her own specialty.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4896"><span class="indent">“U-uh, well! I am a shaman! Can you tell me in detail about this ‘Spirit Communication’?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4897"><span class="indent">Oh, wonderful timing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4898"><span class="indent">I was going to say that it wouldn’t seem appropriate if I did it myself, this was perfect. A female teammate volunteered herself, saying that she could use ‘Spirit Magic’.

I understand now!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4900"><span class="indent">She was skilled in the attribute of ‘Wind’, and her communication with the spirit was very successful.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4901"><span class="indent">“Woah, now we won’t get lost!

But it’s gonna be a huge project to construct the map…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4902"><span class="indent">That’s true. The caster would be exhausted after hearing the voice of the spirit for a prolonged period of time, so it was better to draft a map.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4903"><span class="indent">In my case, Raphael-sensei would handle all that for me.

But for something that any average human could use, perhaps a spell would be more convenient. And it was then that—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4914"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Proposal. the most suitable alternative would be illusion magic ‘Share Thought’.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4915"><span class="italic indent">Oh oh, so you can do that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4916"><span class="indent">I taught ‘Sketch Thought’ and ‘Share Thought’ to the young man who claimed himself to be a sorcerer. He put them to work and found that map making became incredibly simple.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4917"><span class="indent">“Woah, now we won’t get lost!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4918"><span class="indent">“Perhaps we can even easily sketch the structure of the ruins using this magic!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4919"><span class="indent">“Investigations from now on will be so much easier!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4920"><span class="indent">Well, it’s great that my proposals were appreciated so much.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4921"><span class="indent">“We still won’t be able to detect traps or magic mechanisms with the map! So don’t get careless!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4922"><span class="indent">While the teammates were cheering, Kagali-san scolded them and quieted them down.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4923"><span class="italic indent">She sure is something else.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4924"><span class="indent">Without the need of my reminder, she didn’t overlook the remaining risk.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4925"><span class="indent">We headed down for the gate leading to the lowest level that day.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4926"><span class="indent">And we reached our destination before dark.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4927"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I should remain vigilant and observe quietly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4945"><span class="indent">I didn’t forget to keep an extra eye on Kagali-san and her team.

We were using magic to investigate every hallway for traps. We definitely weren’t being careless!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4965"><span class="indent">According to Milim and <span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s accounts, they did not slip up. The other teammates testified for them as well, so it was the truth. It looked like the location had stored some sort of response patterns of specific types of creatures. The trap would be triggered when anyone outside of the registered patterns entered. In that way, unless the visitors knew the wavelengths needed to pass beforehand, there was no way anyone could have decoded that. You could only fight your way through.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4966"><span class="indent">“Then that can’t be helped.

I never expected that when left alone for so long, the weapons would be able to evolve, how surprising…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4971"><span class="indent">Kagali-san was right.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4972"><span class="indent">Luckily, Milim and <span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed them, or the teammates might have been killed by the golems.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4973"><span class="indent">“Nothing happened yesterday, so I was rather reassured.

Analyzing this door seems to need more time, tomorrow—” Kagali-san was abruptly cut off as the earth suddenly began to shake.

AMALITA HAS BEEN INFILTRATED, EXTERMINATE INVADERS!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4990"><span class="indent">The repetition of the voice gave me nothing but a premonition of danger. The situation just went downhill real fast.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4991"><span class="indent">The surface also wouldn’t be safe, and the insides of the ruins were also in a state of emergency.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4992"><span class="indent">“How can this be!

By my estimate it was about one hundred meters long. Its gigantic body could even outmatch Charybdis. It was a shocking sight. It also looked like it was consuming the magicule in its surroundings and gradually gaining in size.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5525"><span class="indent">It could decimate a mountain with a single breath.

I’ve been waiting for you! This is really frustrating for me, because this here is my friend. I was trying to seal him but couldn’t do it.

Why don’t you use your precision attacks to knock out the rest of its body until only the core is left?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5540"><span class="indent">It was just like when we tried to save <span data-term="Phobio" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who was possessed by Charybdis. Milim should be able to avoid attacking the Chaos Dragon’s soul.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5541"><span class="indent">The astral body and spiritual body that were responsible for protecting the Chaos Dragon’s soul had been completely corrupted. Actually, it was the opposite case.

I may accidentally destroy it completely…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5546"><span class="indent">“Didn’t you learn how to control your strength before? Your friend is trying very hard, so you should show the same courage as well!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5547"><span class="indent">I wasn’t going to let her find any excuses now.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5548"><span class="indent">The most important thing here was courage. If we fail—if we were to have such a notion in mind—what could have been a success, would fail anyway.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5549"><span class="indent">“I will assist you. Just follow my instructions and concentrate on unleashing the full force of your magic!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5550"><span class="indent">I was playing cool when I said that I had a plan, but there actually wasn’t any. It would all hinge on Milim just toughing it out.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5551"><span class="indent">But this was not her first try. I had witnessed her doing it once before and it was very successful. The scale this time was different, but it’s the same thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5552"><span class="indent">“Alright.

Watch carefully now, behold the brightness of all the stars in the galaxy—Drago Bustaaa—!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5561"><span class="indent">A blinding light was shot out. It felt as if my brain would be burnt to ash even if I closed my eyes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5562"><span class="indent">Milim unleashed a gigantic swirl of power and it went straight at the Chaos Dragon.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5563"><span class="indent">Its unknown power formed a barrier that impacted Milim’s lightning.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5564"><span class="indent">The two powers began to clash.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5565"><span class="indent">I analyzed the wave of energy and found the source of the Chaos Dragon’s power. I was doing this simultaneously while Raphael-san’s analysis helped Milim control her power.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5566"><span class="indent">It was so heavy. The power was so heavy. I could tell that my magicule was reducing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5567"><span class="indent">With this much energy input, the Chaos Dragon still didn’t seem to have weakened. What a tough foe. I was almost losing hope, but if we gave up here, everything would go south. All my planning had been for times like these. I believed this deeply and gave it all I had.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5568"><span class="indent">On one hand, I tried to calm myself down, and on the other, I slowly tried to get rid of the evil spirit trapping the Chaos Dragon.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5569"><span class="indent">The entire process lasted around one second…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5570"><span class="indent">However, the heavy, oppressive aura I felt in that one instant seemed to last an eternity.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5571"><span class="italic indent">I see it!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5572"><span class="indent">The uncontaminated core of the Chaos Dragon.

It’s going to explode!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5597"><span class="indent">Seeing my signal, Milim stopped her magic.

Before that, I utilized my ‘Devour Soul’ to combine the shreds.

No, I get it now, I finally get it now… Did Raphael-san not mention this for my sake?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5745"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;……&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5746"><span class="indent">It’s all because I was too naive. I hesitated about whether to kill <span data-term="Mariabell" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or not. I should not have hesitated for the sake of the future. If she had tried to inflict harm on me, my doubt would have disappeared. But, since they hadn’t really made too much trouble for us, I felt that it was unnecessary to kill her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5747"><span class="indent">There was also <span data-term="Kai" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I also felt that I had gone overboard, after killing him. That was also one of the reasons for me to be discouraged from doing the same to <span data-term="Mariabell" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5748"><span class="italic indent">I couldn’t kill <span data-term="Mariabell" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—so ‘You’ made the judgement to not tell me about that thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5749"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;…Yes.

Raphael-san must have thought someone like this would be easy to deal with.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5752"><span class="indent">I had no reason to complain. But I also felt frustrated. It was all because of my own incompetence that Raphael-san had to worry about me…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5753"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Negative. That was not the case. I simply did not want Master to put too much mind on the matter.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5754"><span class="italic indent">Thanks. For helping me avoid the guilt afterward too.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5755"><span class="indent">While I was happy about this outcome, I couldn’t let this happen in the future. I had to face what was coming and make decisions based on my own will. Or else how would I be qualified to be Raphael’s master?

That was the pistol name that actually exists in real life, “Walther P99”. We were going to use kanji for the numbers, but it seems that weapons from the real world are an exception to that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5786"><span class="indent">The weapon that Glenda used in the novel was a semi-automatic pistol developed by the German weapon manufacturer Walther. And of course, it is real.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5787"><span class="indent">At first, I was considering whether I should use a pistol produced by Beretta, such as the M92 or PX4, but if I did, it may get mixed up with the character Beretta. That’s why I got pretty frustrated trying to decide which gun to choose, before finally settling on the P99.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5788"><span class="indent">Speaking of Walther, their P38 is quite famous. The highly popular master thief (Lupin III)</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Lupin the Third is a Japanese manga series." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">&nbsp;also uses this weapon, so it’s very well known. I initially wanted to get some of his clout but decided not to in the end.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5789"><span class="indent">Glenda-san is a female, so a smaller and more compact weapon is probably more suited for her. Based on this consideration, I settled on the gun that was introduced this time, the “Walther P99”.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5790"><span class="indent">Its name only appeared once, but in order to write about it, I researched a bunch and even bought an airsoft version of it. It was then that I recalled I wanted one when I was a kid. I suppose this can be considered as me fulfilling a childhood dream, now that I have the money as an adult—uh, but I digress.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5791"><span class="indent">That’s the type of gun it was. I plan to make it show up a couple of times in the future as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5792"><span class="indent">There are mechanical and magic type pistols. While the pistols in question have the same names, the two are very different from each other. For instance, the gun <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> brought to the exploration was only a recreated copy. It only looked similar in appearance. It also seemed to require gunpowder, but I felt that there was too much complication. Can’t we make it a bit simpler? That’s why I gave the final pistol some magic modification.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5793"><span class="indent">Furthermore, in the book I hinted at the fact that the Empire had guns as well. So, I plan to write something completely different for them. I only made the magic-modified guns with reference to the way that <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others thought.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5794"><span class="indent">That’s how I felt.

On the other hand, the series of magic dolls, like Beretta, would be named after gun manufacturers.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5796"><span class="indent">In the web novel, Beretta didn’t have any brothers.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5797"><span class="indent">So, what should we do?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5798"><span class="indent">The reason why we mentioned naming Walther was in hope that <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would recall the matter…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5799"><span class="indent">Sig, Colt, Glock, Mauser, Mateba, Remington. There are also the twins, Heckler and Koch. There are also tons of other candidates, but these are the only ones that made it in.
