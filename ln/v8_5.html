I am able to relax my body and stay in a relatively free state. This is surprisingly comfortable. And since the wires are flexible, my body can, in fact, move. However, the wires won’t break regardless of how hard I struggle, and all I achieved by moving so much is causing myself nausea.

That’s worrying, but—right now I’ve got no time to worry about others!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_58"><span class="indent">Right now, I am facing a real crisis. Even though it’s pretty terrible to have an empty stomach, a far more pressing issue has come up.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_59"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_60"><span class="italic indent">Piii~guruguruguru…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_61"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_62"><span class="indent">My stomach hurts… I’m able to keep the pee in, but now I’m faced with a number two.

Right now, I’m dangling in a living room with a fur carpet just below my feet. It would be another thing if it were a carved stone floor, but if I get such an expensive looking carpet dirty, even Kaijin-san would be mad… The same goes for <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, he will probably be furious at me for causing havoc in the room, someone who has never really paid any attention when he explained stuff like going to the restroom and taking showers.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_64"><span class="indent">It would seem, right now, that my situation isn’t only making me uncomfortable, but putting me in danger. So, then what should I do… No, it’s not just a little… this is </span><span class="italic indent">really</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;bad…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_65"><span class="indent">My body started convulsing while I struggled to endure, causing the vibrations to pass onto the wires, starting very subtle oscillations. If this continues, it is only a matter of time before great tragedy strikes.

No solution now; I’m completely out of options. The sweat that had built up started flowing down, getting into my eyes, and blurring my vision. If there is no way out, then I should just give up, and let it all out—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_66"><span class="indent">No, wait a second? Speaking of which… To the desperate me, I heard voices akin to heaven’s call:</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_67"><span class="italic indent">“If you ever feel like giving up, just try summoning your buddy to save yourself!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_68"><span class="indent">That’s true, <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama did say that. I’m definitely being tested! And knowing this, I must be able to summon one in an instant.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_69"><span class="italic indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_70"><span class="italic indent">Buddy, please come! If you don’t come quickly enough, something horrible is going to happen!!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_71"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_72"><span class="indent">I called out in my heart, and with that I felt the transmission of the message to the direwolf, who had not experienced this before.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_73"><span class="italic indent">Seems to be working!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_74"><span class="indent">And so, I kept calling after my first attempt and was able to grasp the connection of consciousness by the third time. If that’s what it takes, then it’d be a lot simpler since my psyche has already been tormented to its limit at this point.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_75"><span class="indent">At long last, I was able to successfully summon the buddy before reaching my absolute limit and let it carry me to the toilet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_76"><span class="indent">But what happened next in the toilet, when I emptied my bowels and lost my grip on reality, will remain a secret.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_77"><span class="indent">Luckily, all of this happened days before <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama returned, giving me enough time to clean up any and all traces. Due to actually managing to summon a companion, I was quite surprised by myself, which cheered me up a bit.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_78"><span class="indent">But this is certain, I don’t plan to tell anyone at all that I had almost failed in doing so.

It wasn’t hard to move around, nor did I ever feel tired. To the care-free me, there was no inconvenience at all.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_88"><span class="indent">However, I encountered a huge problem…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_89"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_90"><span class="indent">……</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_91"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_92"><span class="indent">I came to the famous hostess club known as the Night Butterfly. As a token of appreciation, Kaijin-san brought me here. Although I wasn’t really interested, I couldn’t say no given how persistent he was.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_93"><span class="indent">It’s true! I really had no interest. It was just that Kaijin wouldn’t back down… Alright, I’ll admit it. I did have </span><span class="italic indent">some </span><span class="indent">interest. It had been a long time since I could drink with beautiful oneesans, so I was pretty pumped to go to the club.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_94"><span class="indent">BUT!!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_95"><span class="indent">No matter how much I drank, I just couldn’t get drunk. Now believe me, it was an </span><span class="italic indent">incredibly serious</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;problem. Kaijin had gone through all the trouble of bringing me here, so this would surely cut the fun in half. I tried my hardest to get drunk, but since I couldn’t even taste the drink, this seemed like a futile effort. I was determined and steadfast in my resolve, but it was no use.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_96"><span class="indent">However, drinking was not the only fun thing to enjoy here. I am the type of man (slime) who is quick to adapt and won’t give up before the first tiny obstacle that comes my way!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_97"><span class="indent">It’s precisely for that reason, that I was intent on letting the Night Butterfly live up to its name. I want to enjoy playing with the elven oneesans who were renowned for their beauty.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_98"><span class="indent">But there was another issue. Although I previously didn’t have a problem with my slime body, I now had a massive complaint. The issue this time being—I didn’t have hands. It was rare to have so many elven oneesans in one place, it would surely be a huge problem if I couldn’t touch them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_99"><span class="indent">I was being held by a tender and slim arm while being crushed by ample bosoms.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_100"><span class="italic indent">This feels so good! Did I die and go to heaven after all!?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_101"><span class="indent">I could shout with joy in this type of heavenly situation… But it was saddening that I couldn’t do anything further due to my tragic lack of hands. I thought back to all the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> I had preyed upon prior to this day. Hands, tentacles, I put all of the mental energy I could muster into channeling my thoughts in an effort to produce these appendages.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_102"><span class="indent">It was times like this that I needed my Unique Skill ‘Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ the most, and thus gave it the order.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_103"><span class="indent">However—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_104"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Answer. Insufficient data, creation of the designated organ has failed.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_105"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_106"><span class="indent">It’s futile!! What type of ‘Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ is this?! Completely useless in my hour of need.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_107"><span class="indent">But, meh, the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> I’d preyed upon—snakes, centipedes, spiders, bats, lizards, wolves—now that I thought about it, none of them had what it takes to create what I needed in that moment. With a heavy heart, I regretfully came to terms with my inability to squeeze any breasts.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_108"><span class="indent">BUT! I wasn’t the type of man to give up here.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_109"><span class="indent">Even if I couldn’t squeeze anything, I could still enjoy the sweet fragrance of these elven oneesans. Being surrounded by their bountiful bosoms and enjoying such heavenly fragrance. This truly was the greatest meaning in life for a man.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_110"><span class="italic indent">So let me enjoy it already.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_111"><span class="indent">I drew in deep breaths and reveled in the sweet aroma of their perfume. For now, my Skill ‘Keen Smell’ acquired from the direwolf alpha was put to great use. I was exceedingly satisfied with the scent of elven beauties and wanted to explore it further.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_112"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Answer. The substance is composed of perfume, female hormone estrogen, oxytocin—&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_113"><span class="italic indent">STOP! NO, that’s not at all what I meant!!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_114"><span class="indent">I didn’t want to know these details…doing so would diminish their pure beauty. For real, was the name ‘Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ just for show? What a useless Skill.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_115"><span class="indent">So, I explained to Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in detail, that I actually just wanted to take in the wonders brought by the fragrance; but knowing too much was definitely not allowed. Certain things were perfect at just the right amount, as with all things in life, there are lines that shouldn’t be crossed. Even if one wishes to know, one shouldn’t know; even if one wishes to see, one shouldn’t see. That is the quintessential state, called Gokui</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">. Humans would lose interest in things if they knew too much. Therefore, you had to approach the limit, but then restrain yourself from going any further. One might say it is the art of only getting a brief glimpse of something. By subverting your intellectual curiosity, you can amplify the excitement. It’s an adult thing that only professionals can grasp.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_116"><span class="indent">I explained these things triumphantly to Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_117"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;…Answer. Understood&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_118"><span class="italic indent">Really?</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;It may be a ‘Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ after all. My passion must have reached it on a deeper level, allowing it to understand this marvelous concept.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_119"><span class="indent">Equipped with this deep knowledge, Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did a fantastic job. Letting me sense things right up until that point when it almost became unbearable. To be precise, I was able to interpret their emotions just by their smell alone.

It would take at least a couple of months to even teach them elementary arithmetic. It was a time-consuming process for these guys, so they couldn’t just pick up skills by studying in their free time during work. But that was only natural, considering that these <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had never needed to study before in their life. They were a bunch who had good muscle memory but were lacking in brainpower. The capable ones could simply obtain skills by feeling like doing so.

As the latter method would undoubtedly be met with failure, we realized we would need to find backup personnel.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_918"><span class="indent">And so, I decided to pay a visit to <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> since he was well-known among merchants to be good at accounting.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_919"><span class="indent">However, the real goal of my visit was to get him to help me gather new ingredients in order to develop new meals that we could bring to the market.

Had it been a son, she would have been on the throne long ago.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1707"><span class="indent">Emilia, as a high-ranking noble, was keenly aware of the intrigue and conflicts within the harem. She seized control of the palace where Blanche and Letitia resided in little time. Blanche’s nannies as well the maids who cared much for her were all dismissed for fabricated reasons. None had the audacity to defy the second princess, and the servants relegated to the harem no longer obeyed the king, but her. And as a result, Blanche and her mother became neglected.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1708"><span class="indent">In stark contrast, Blanche’s sister Ashla—who was less than a year younger—received affectionate care as the second young princess. Everything was according to Emilia’s plan.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1709"><span class="indent">The king had no siblings, granting Blanche the first right of succession. If the second princess, Emilia, were to conceive a prince, he would’ve been guaranteed the throne. Even if that failed, there was still Ashla. And if Blanche ceased to exist, the royal claim would fall into Ashla’s hands, leaving her to be crowned as the next queen of Silberia.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1710"><span class="italic indent">For that, I just have to deal with the meddling mother and daughter in my way.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1711"><span class="indent">The ambitious Emilia resorted to far crueler, clandestine tactics in order to advance her blood to the throne.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1712"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1713"><span class="indent">It was a fateful winter day.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1714"><span class="indent">On Blanche’s twelfth birthday, her mother the first princess passed away. A blanket of snow cloaked the courtyard. Blanche hid and sobbed alone in a corner no one could see. To Blanche, her father, the king, was a distant figure. And now she had no one left to be called a family. Blanche could only cry, feeling utter despair and sorrow.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1715"><span class="indent">Suddenly, someone called out to the weeping Blanche.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1716"><span class="indent">“Why are you crying?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1717"><span class="indent">Blanche raised her head to see the source of the voice. It was a breathtaking sight; someone with beauty beyond humans. No, it was a non-human existence that only she could see. However, at the time, it mattered not to her, whether the individual was human or not.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1718"><span class="indent">“How beautiful…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1719"><span class="indent">Blanche opened her heart to the beauty that could drive out anyone’s sadness.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1720"><span class="indent">She even forgot about her promise to her mother.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1721"><span class="indent">Such was the incredible impact of this beauty.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1722"><span class="indent">“Ho, thank you.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1723"><span class="indent">Perhaps she had sensed Blanche’s sincerity. A smile emerged on her emotionless face, an extraordinarily destructive smile. A beauty that drove away even the falling snow. Her long hair floated in the wind, a more brilliant white than the snowflakes. Sharing Blanche’s red pupils, a deep scarlet, more vivid than blood. With skin that was an immaculate white, nigh transparent. Her dark dress, as if to obscure this brilliance, concealed her body. An existence beyond human realms. Whoever laid their eyes—be they as special as hers or not—upon this beauty would find that she transcended humans’ very grasp. Such a beautiful female smiled towards Blanche.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1724"><span class="indent">“My mother passed away.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1725"><span class="indent">“Is that so…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1726"><span class="indent">“I’ve become an abandoned child.

Whatever this non-human’s intentions may have been, it no longer mattered.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1731"><span class="indent">“Because you can see me. Your white hair, red eyes, are the same as mine.

But I would also like you to hear my request.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1738"><span class="indent">“It’s all right.

Her elegant actions and attitude are perfect no matter how you see it.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1773"><span class="indent">“She’s well versed in history, art, and mathematics. Even geography and sociology. The amount of knowledge she possesses is commendable.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1774"><span class="indent">“More importantly, her theory of magic is fantastic! Her analysis of spells does not have a single unnecessary line and she’s able to improve her magical efficiency through simplification of spells. This level of talent is beyond genius, what an outstanding princess!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1775"><span class="indent">The royal tutors appointed by the king complemented her unsparingly. And the one most frustrated by this was her sister, Princess Ashla. As they walked past each other in the hallway, Ashla began to pick on Blanche.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1776"><span class="indent">“My, my, isn’t this my sister dear. Greetings to you. Have you been studying hard today as well? Although that’s important, you’ll be disliked if you don’t go kiss Duke Grunce’s son Lord Guinias’s ass properly, you know?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1777"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1778"><span class="indent">The family of Duke Grunce, the famous royal family known since ancient times as the maintainers of Namrium. A noble family, powerful even within the Eastern Empire. Grunce’s domain alone held a population of three hundred thousand. The heir to such nobility from the Empire had been staying around Silberia since a year ago.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1779"><span class="indent">Guinias Nam Grunce. Age twenty-two, a young man talented in many fields. Guinias had an elder brother who’d been appointed as the next duke. Because of that, it was rumored that Guinias had laid his sights on the throne of Silberia. It was an open secret among the Silberian public, most of who supported such an attempt. There were many reasons for it, the most pertinent one being to maintain friendly relations with the Empire. If the big shot noble became the king of Silberia, they expected less pressure to be exerted on this province state.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1780"><span class="indent">There was also another reason. Guinias had imported a variety of wares into Silberia by leveraging his connections through Grunce, successfully winning the favor of the kingdom’s nobility with those extremely attractive goods. Those imports were also highly profitable within the kingdom and improved the citizens’ well-being. And for that reason, support for Guinias within the kingdom rose sky-high without any sign of slowing down.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1781"><span class="indent">That was how Guinias secured his remarkable popularity in Silberia. He was still young and handsome, and already brought great wealth to the nation, so becoming son-in-law of the queen wasn’t far off—that was the opinion of many within the nation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1782"><span class="indent">And the one Guinias had laid his eyes on was Princess Blanche, who had been guarding a secret. King Silberia was mindful of the marriage’s significance, only vowing to give his blessing should Guinias strive to help Blanche become the next queen. Guinias swiftly promised his commitment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1783"><span class="indent">That meant making Blanche the next queen. Ashla couldn’t stand the idea of Blanche getting crowded, she couldn’t tolerate the thought of her rising to prominence once more. Besides, her mother Emilia had also been outraged by this. She exploited many tactics and invested a great deal of time and effort throughout the years to help her own daughter become the next queen, yet it had all been ruined by the appearance of Guinias. Even the nobles among Emilia’s circle had begun to flatter Guinias. If that were to continue, they would be handing the queen’s throne to Blanche.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1784"><span class="indent">But there was still a way, as long as she could change Guinias’s heart. Emilia instilled this into Ashla, hoping she would win Lord Guinias’s heart instead. But even if she hadn’t told her so, Ashla shared the same intent. She had gone to great lengths to jeopardize her sister’s relationship with him in order to snatch her fiancé.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1785"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1786"><span class="indent">This act was also part of her scheme, but Blanche didn’t really mind.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1787"><span class="indent">“Oh, Ash. Good health to you. I’m glad you are concerned for me. But it’s really nothing. I shall be accompanying Guinias-sama to walk the city later.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1788"><span class="indent">“…Is that so. You make me jealous. Very well, I hope you have a pleasant time.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1789"><span class="indent">“Hmm. It’s work, after all, one should not indulge their desire for pleasure.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1790"><span class="indent">Like that, she was able to dismantle Ashla’s effort to provoke her. Blanche was hardly a young child anymore. She’d been hard at work behind everyone’s back to gain knowledge and power. Nowadays, even those servants couldn’t openly harass her, instead they had to find other subtler ways to do so. Likewise for Ashla, who could merely attempt to provoke her through sarcasm. And for that reason, her hatred for Blanche festered day by day. Yet Blanche seemed unfazed even knowing so.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1791"><span class="indent">If anything, she seemed to no longer be alone.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1792"><span class="indent">&lt;Yes, that’s the way to go. Treat everyone around you as an enemy. However, there’s no need to defeat them all. You need only to differentiate those who can and cannot be manipulated. Hold on to their secrets to force them into serving you. Your sister is but a pawn used by that mother named Emilia. Neither is she useful nor a threat to your presence.&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1793"><span class="indent">&lt;I understand, big sis.&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1794"><span class="indent">She now had a reliable friend named Blanc. That was why she become strong. Her knowledge and magic were all taught by Blanc. Blanche accepted and humbly learned her teachings and had grown dramatically in the past three years.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1795"><span class="indent">“Huh! Then be cautious when you do have some fun.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1796"><span class="indent">“I will, you do that too, Ash.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1797"><span class="indent">The two princesses appeared to coexist in harmony, yet the mutual hostility within their hearts burned like wildfire; thankfully, any confrontations dissolved before escalating.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1798"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1799"><span class="indent">Just like that, Blanche developed day by day, gaining more and more supporters. She’d also been doing quite well with Guinias, at some point they came to represent the ideal couple. The number of people backing Guinias steadily increased with it. The nobles who were still observing the situation also started to step forward in recognizing Blanche as the next queen in line.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1800"><span class="indent">During this period, Emilia’s intervention attempts became more radical. She scantly cared about decency anymore and resorted to bloodthirsty violence, ordering the assassination of Blanche.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1801"><span class="indent">However, every attempt amounted to failure. That was to be expected; Blanc within Blanche wouldn’t deign to let mere hitmen harm her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1802"><span class="indent">It was smooth sailing. All signs pointed towards her becoming the new queen in due time. The citizenry deemed the increasingly beautiful Blanche as worthy of being their queen. She also gathered the confidence to show a delightful smile to people other than Blanc. That was her sign for having bonded with others, something that Blanc expected from her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1803"><span class="indent">But there were still parts which she was dissatisfied with. That would be Blanche’s relationship with Guinias.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1804"><span class="italic indent">…This is a real headache. “Romance” is an emotion that begets naught but uncertainty, nothing good whatsoever comes of it. If Blanche’s emotions are to be significantly affected, then I’ll have to confront whatever should follow. God damn hum—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1805"><span class="indent">But, if Blanche could be happy, Blanc didn’t really mind. Even if her partner were a stupid human, she would send them her blessing truthfully. Nothing less could be expected of Blanche’s friend.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1806"><span class="indent">However—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1807"><span class="indent">Blanc had a very bad feeling about Guinias.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1808"><span class="indent">Setting aside incarnation and rebirth into this world, Blanc was currently in an incomplete state. Likewise, her subordinates were only of spiritual existence and had limited impact on the physical world. Despite these circumstances, Blanc would try her best to strategize accordingly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1809"><span class="indent">She would later come to find her apprehension manifesting in reality.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1810"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

These, however, revealed some significant issues.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1815"><span class="italic indent">Even though I’ve always been on high alert with that man, I couldn’t have expected his comprehensive defense against <span data-term="demons" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

There were several reasons to explain why, but the most prevalent one was monetary and pragmatic. To establish a new industry, he had considered exploring the mines containing magicule ores. In fact, the Kingdom of Silberia possessed a high concentration of magicule, leading to the ores collected from the mine being of high quality. And Duke Grunce’s territory bought them at a high price.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1831"><span class="indent">Before his arrival, Silberia was a nation sustained through primary industry such as agriculture, farming, and fishing. Citizens were mostly care-free people that led a self-sustained, simple lifestyle.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1832"><span class="indent">But now, the seeds of profiteering industries were planted. Alongside those, a number of entertainment industries began to take root. One of the most popular attractions was gambling at horse races. Given the insidious nature of gambling, those who turned rich overnight became obsessed with it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1833"><span class="indent">The kind and modest citizens were gradually corrupted, bit by bit. Financial troubles came to grasp the less fortunate, where Guinias astutely lent them his money with a smile. This generosity propelled his support to unseen heights. Other than having a populist foundation, Guinias had executed his preparations in every field. He steadily expanded his influence by welcoming the influx of nobility that attempted to befriend him. He threw out his money by the bucketload in the name of Grunce, the largest noble family in the Empire, and then subsequently recycled the money back into his own pocket. His actions all reflected his immense talents.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1834"><span class="indent">Everything went according to the master plan.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1835"><span class="indent">“This is fairly boring, to be honest,” Guinias sneered coldly. “There’s no fun now that everything is running perfectly according to my plan.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1836"><span class="indent">“Hahaha, Guinias-sama. Please don’t say so. This type of remote backwater will go nuts over some pitiful fun. It really can’t be helped.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1837"><span class="indent">The one complimenting Guinias was one of his aides from the home country. To the public he was nothing more than a minister-type butler who helped Guinias with random chores, given his status.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1838"><span class="indent">“Huh! Nevertheless, I still couldn’t get my way with the key figure, Blanche. Can’t that woman just accept me already? She always responds to me with some nonsense about keeping her chastity before marriage.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1839"><span class="indent">“Well, forget not that she is the princess of a nation. It’s understandable.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1840"><span class="indent">“Everything has been moving as planned, except for this woman. She irritates me to no end,” Guinias complained. This was his nature, beneath his façade as a noble heir.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1841"><span class="indent">“Okay, okay, Guinias-sama. You needn’t keep that unpleasant look. You won’t have to endure for long.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1842"><span class="indent">The one responding to him, a measly and cruel looking man, was another trusted subordinate of Guinias, who was in charge of his finances. He had been promised the role of the royal merchant in the land of Duke Grunce upon Guinias becoming a duke. To this end, he only needed to serve Guinias by investing and spreading money to Guinias’s desires.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1843"><span class="indent">“Ho? Have the preparations been finished?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1844"><span class="indent">“Yes.

At last our plan has reached its final stage. My days as a duke are imminent, I await the time with pleasure.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1846"><span class="indent">Guinias fantasized about the near future, wearing a despicable grin on his face.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1847"><span class="indent">Their plan was straightforward. Guinias was to pretend to marry into the royal family by being engaged with Blanche, who had the claim to the throne. But in reality, Guinias was not satisfied with merely being the king of Silberia—his dream was to become the duke of Grunce.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1848"><span class="indent">His brother had become an eyesore as of late, but that had already been dealt with. If he was to rebel, Guinias already considered disposing of him. But his brother was aware of his younger brother’s nature; knowing their difference in ability, he had already assumed a position within Guinias’s military.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1849"><span class="indent">Guinias’s future as a duke was set in stone. So, one might ask why he would visit the Kingdom of Silberia in the first place…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1850"><span class="indent">“Anyhow, Guinias-sama, would Blanche be willing to leave with us as planned?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1851"><span class="indent">“Huh. We haven’t slept, but that woman has already fallen for me. I don’t think she will refuse, but just in case, I’ve tipped the military.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1852"><span class="indent">“I see. If possible, we should avoid using violence. For some reason, I sense the forthcoming of an unnatural power if we were to invade this land with force.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1853"><span class="indent">“Our party agrees to that as well, let’s try to avoid war. Guinias-dono, it would trouble me greatly should this land fall to warfare. Facing such a development, I would need to reevaluate my relationship with you. To me, it would truly be a shame to not be able to maintain our partnership, but I wish to be on good terms with my granddaughter, who is soon to be crowned. If Duke Grunce’s household is to forge an alliance with us, we the subjects of the Kingdom of Silberia could live long and prosper as well.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1854"><span class="indent">The one pandering was Emilia’s father, Marquis Barnes. He had collected intelligence himself, anticipating his ruthless daughter lunging towards more violent actions. And through his instinct as a nobleman, he discerned that Guinias’s end-goal was never the throne of this kingdom. Barnes then took a gamble in order to make his granddaughter the queen, and approached Guinias, inquiring his true intent.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1855"><span class="indent">In the end, Barnes was accepted by Guinias and thus expressed his true thoughts. Guinias wanted to bring Blanche to his home country, and Barnes saw Blanche as a burden, best to be evicted from Silberia. Bound by a mutual goal, they decided to form an alliance. And it was for that reason that Barnes wholeheartedly wished to avoid any conflict with the Empire.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1856"><span class="indent">“Then, Marquis Barnes, would you be able to keep this country’s nobles under control?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1857"><span class="indent">“Of course. Even if the king or Princess Blanche herself object, most of the nobles are on Guinias-sama’s side,” Barnes carefully responded to the young and not-yet-Duke Guinias. This was, indeed, a reflection of the overwhelming difference in power between big and small nations. Barnes had to force a smile for the sake of his granddaughter, as well as his own authority, even if it repulsed him. In spite Guinias already having seen through Barnes’s act, he kept on smiling as if unaware.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1858"><span class="indent">“Very well, then when shall we execute the plan?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1859"><span class="indent">To Guinias, who wished to return home as soon as possible, the sooner, the better. However, he had endured for so long and cautiously planned his every step, so it would have been unwise to rush and mess up in the end. To ensure the success of the plan, the date of execution was extremely crucial.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1860"><span class="indent">“Let’s see…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1861"><span class="indent">“It would only take a few days to surround the area completely with the formation of the army.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1862"><span class="indent">“The next festival of sacrifice at the palace, which happens to be Princess Blanche’s sixteenth birthday.

How dare you say that to me, you-you are just a little girl—ah…!?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2027"><span class="indent">Barnes, as arrogantly as ever, looked into Blanc’s eyes and felt a sensation of ice-cold water being poured onto his heart and the biting frost climbed down his back. With a broken spirit he was reduced to observing his surroundings. He stood where all the losers were supposed to be, yet not a single soul remained. The figures of losers who could only lament their defeat through the scheme of Guinias. The only person in front of him was Blanc.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2028"><span class="indent">“Blanche…is no more. Try to use your remaining few brain cells to try to understand me now.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2029"><span class="indent">Only hearing that did Barnes begin to notice how strange Blanc looked. Blanche had always been a pretty girl, but the one in front of him couldn’t simply be described as beautiful. Her hair, whiter than snow, decorated the throne whilst she spitefully gazed down at Barnes with her crimson eyes. The gaps between her dark dress vaguely flashed her smooth white skin. Its seductive gleam could instill lust, yet before all else, it showed them fear. It was the type of beauty beyond human comprehension.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2030"><span class="indent">Barnes became speechless having guessed her true identity.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2031"><span class="indent">“C-could it be…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2032"><span class="indent">“Settle down, now. Soon I’ll invite your family and friends here too, let us have a celebration.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2033"><span class="indent">Marquis Barnes had no right to refuse. Before he could say a thing, he was shackled in front of the throne. Then, another couple minutes passed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2034"><span class="indent">“Slow down this instant! Who do you think I am!!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2035"><span class="indent">A woman shrieked words akin to Barnes’s.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2036"><span class="indent">“What are you doing! Are you knowingly offending the next queen!?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2037"><span class="indent">The other was a foolish young girl radiating an arrogant attitude without even knowing what she had gotten herself into. The two of them were brought before Blanc.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2038"><span class="indent">“I guess it runs in the genes. Perhaps it will help all of you reflect on yourselves if this girl sheds a little blood.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2039"><span class="indent">She may have been the heir to the king’s blood, yet she held no significance to Blanc. Ostensibly forgetting about that, she glanced over the two who had been brought in front of her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2040"><span class="indent">“Blanche… What are you doing here!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2041"><span class="indent">“Sister, please understand you position. Wife of the Imperial nobleman is just an empty title. Do you understand that you are a mere lamb waiting to be slaughtered without anyone to back you?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2042"><span class="indent">People unable to comprehend their circumstances tried to argue against Blanc. But that folly was devoured by a fiery blaze once Blanc’s eyes focused on her.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2043"><span class="indent">“I-I fee-feel horrible! Ca-can’t brea—!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2044"><span class="indent">“KYAA! I-it burns!

I will not let you off the hook that easily for bullying my friend all these years.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2046"><span class="indent">Hearing that cold and emotionless voice, it struck Emilia and Ashla that he one before them was not Blanche. By that time, it was already far too late. But, even if they had understood any earlier, Blanc would not have forgiven them anyway.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2047"><span class="indent">“You two should wait here for our final guest to show up,” Blanc said without even dignifying the wretched women with a glance.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2048"><span class="indent">The last one—the man with the most sins. Only the hatred towards him burned quietly deep-within Blanc’s eyes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2049"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Their faces torn, twisted with agony, blood flowing out of their body without end. They writhed in pain—people, people everywhere. The once tidy streets were tainted with blood, while fresh blood kept gushing into the lake. It was dyeing the lake scarlet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2076"><span class="indent">“WHAT!?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2077"><span class="indent">Guinias was speechless at the sight, but he soon regained clarity and howled: “You damn <span data-term="demons" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!

At heart, he was not a man of pure evil. He’d contracted all the self-serving habits of a noble, and it was his sincere conviction that a noble was nothing without their people. First improve citizens’ standard of living, entrap their support through entertainment, then milk them through taxation and their labor. Because those were his previously held beliefs, his heart began to shake upon seeing so many people being slaughtered below him.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2090"><span class="italic indent">I-I’ve done nothing wrong.

Why are you crying so much? Have you pissed yourself too?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2099"><span class="indent">“Someone save me, I’m begging you, please spare me,” Guinias wailed while sobbing like a bitch. Hearing this, Blanc’s laughter echoed with joy.

You won’t feel lonely that way.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2104"><span class="indent">In front of Blanc lay Guinias’s companions’ figures, their faces filled with fear and agony, and their bodies ugly, distorted, and rotten. They’d been stripped of all clothing; their dignity as high nobility was a thing of the past.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2105"><span class="indent">“N-no!
