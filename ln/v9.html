As someone who had lived their whole life as a nobleman, it would be hard for Kazak to adapt his lifestyle.

There was a need for a large and powerful country like Dwargon to show its majesty to the nobles of other countries that would be visiting the festival.

And even when it happened, there would be insurance agencies that would respond. However, it was always a big problem when carriages broke down in this world.

Beautiful elven ladies were roaming around the banquet hall carrying various kinds of alcoholic beverages. Those who were accustomed to wearing formal dress seemed to be enraptured by the Yukata adorned elves’ voluptuous figures. In addition, the way the elves greeted the guests by putting three fingers on the floor, shook the hearts of men equally among all nations. I could see their faces turn red even when they weren’t drunk.

In the banquet hall, at the dividing line between the Japanese traditional space and the western space, a large fish was being carted in.

I believe only in this way can we build a better future.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1535"><span class="indent">I observed everyone’s reaction as I continued my speech. It seemed that everyone was intently hanging onto my every word. This not only applied to citizens of our kingdom, but also to the peasants that came for the celebration. I continued:</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1536"><span class="indent">“Some may be wary of the fact that I am a <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. While this sense of caution is understandable, I hope everyone would put trust into your genuine feelings. I won’t force you to accept my views. It would certainly be pleasant if you were to find me trust-worthy, but even if you are not willing to trust me, it is something that cannot be helped.

However, how the people interpreted my message was entirely up to them. Next, I addressed the royal ruling classes:</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1538"><span class="indent">“Fellow nobles gathered today, I hope that you will relay what you see and hear here today honestly when you return to your respective nations. Some kingdoms have already established diplomatic ties with us. Even if you can’t put your faith in us, will you not find those nations trust-worthy? I hope that you will not be prejudiced simply for the fact that I am a monster and a <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1539"><span class="indent">With that being said, this wasn’t something they could determine by themselves.

Perhaps some would consider me as a threat for doing so, but those were just my honest opinions. I disliked war, but if anyone dared to invade our kingdom, I would retaliate without hesitation. An indecisive ruler will only bring about harm, especially for innocent civilians.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1543"><span class="indent">After all, ensuring the lives and properties of our citizens was the responsibility of the state. It was my primary objective to protect, and that included friendly monsters as well as future immigrants. A world without military conflict was nothing but an idealistic dream. A citizen had every freedom and right to dream about peace and prosperity, but that wasn’t a luxury rulers could afford. They needed to always be on their feet, ready to handle any situation that may arise. This was the bare minimum for a nation to function. That was my justification for the speech I just delivered to the higher-class guests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1544"><span class="indent">And to wrap it all up—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1545"><span class="indent">“Whether you’re a merchant, adventurer, or peasant, I swear not to lay my hands on common civilians. But that does not apply to criminals. Our country is lacking in manpower. As such, there are plenty of jobs available, so anyone who wishes to fill an empty role can consider immigrating. Naturally, with more people come more opportunities. Here, you will have freedom of speech and the ability to choose the occupation that you desire. But even so, please speak and act responsibly. If you are still interested in our nation after my speech, please consider my proposition. There are all sorts of events planned for our nation in the future as well. Today’s Tempest <span data-term="Founding Festival" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is but the first debut project.

I was just a clerk working nine-to-five in my previous life, which is why my speech was nowhere near as eloquent as those delivered by kings and nobles despite my quick rise to fame.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1550"><span class="indent">But, even with that being the case—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1551"><span class="indent">The crowd exploded into deafening cheers. My citizens aside, even the visitors were in an uproar. Although there must also be people who still had their suspicions, most people were willing to trust me and put their faith in this nation.

All that’s left was to see their reactions.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1552"><span class="indent">And so, with my speech, the Tempest <span data-term="Founding Festival" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was officially commenced.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1553"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_1554"><span class="indent">***</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1555"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1556"><span class="indent">After the speech, I made my way to the main hall on the ground floor.

We only arranged these high-quality chairs in this particular manner after considering the acoustic effect in the theatre.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1691"><span class="indent">The guests were seated properly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1692"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1693"><span class="indent">The standard of culture in this world was a bit lower when compared to Japan. This was…umm, a genuine observation even from other people’s point of view. While there was a relatively high artistic and musical achievement, that was limited to royalty and nobility. They were entertainment for the upper echelon that had both an abundance of money and time. The angels would assault any city that developed past a certain threshold. As a result, most aspects of advanced culture were tucked away in the realms of the privileged. To the nobles, these forms of culture were merely considered as minor entertainment. But to me, culture was something that required a collective effort to build together.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1694"><span class="indent">Geniuses had been buried in this world. It was not only difficult to discover the genius in these fields in a world with such a narrow view, but they may also even be buried and eventually not be developed for their entire lives. Art is the product of entertainment spawned from extra vitality of life, and the same goes for any innovation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1695"><span class="indent">In this world, the search for such things is a luxury, but I’m not giving up because of it. I will, however, search the world to discover the geniuses that were overshadowed by the average people. In order to achieve this, first I need to foster a culture appreciation trend within my nation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1696"><span class="indent">And the first step is—today’s appreciation concert. There were plenty of musical instruments in this world that were similar to my original world. To my surprise, there was even something like a piano.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1697"><span class="indent">And these were all discovered at Clayman’s base. He seemed to have been living life no worse than court royals. In one of the countless luxuriously decorated rooms of his, he had stored a large number of instruments. Some monsters already understood music. They seemed to play beats to the performance of flute and taigo</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Japanese drum instrument" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">. They also had a culture of holding festivals every year. I loaned instruments to these people and, with time, their talents here and there blossomed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1698"><span class="indent">We prepared instruments for those conscious of learning, and gave them basic instructions such as teaching them how to read music notes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1699"><span class="indent">My knowledge alone was hardly enough, and it was a time like this that <span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Raphael would shine. With the music schoolbook from Japan combined with the knowledge related to instruments within the library of this world, we produced a paper book. How amazing(-ly terrifying) it was for Raphael to recreate such long-forgotten knowledge of mine.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1700"><span class="indent">The personal effort of the monsters came next. As the saying goes, “Interest is the best teacher,” soon enough, the monsters started to master their favorite instruments.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1701"><span class="indent">By the way, I also had someone faithfully recreate the music notes. I wasn’t someone qualified with traits such as “pitch perfect hearing,” but it was no problem for Raphael-san. Not only did it recreate the sheet music, it even re-composed the songs. Although I was worried about copyright issues, there was no JASRAC</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Japanese Society for Rights of Authors" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent">&nbsp;in this world. Moreover, the rights holders were not here either. </span><span class="italic indent">So please give me some leeway for wanting to further foster the culture.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1702"><span class="indent">Our powerhouse was comprised of violinists, but there were also instruments such as the trumpet and kettledrum. While it was surprising to see that there were pianos, how easily the monsters played them moved me quite a bit.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1703"><span class="indent">The opinion on whether to add a piano into the orchestra was split. But this alone was not enough to concern me too much. If we wanted to further dramatize the performance with the addition of a piano, we should just add it in. I wasn’t musically talented, so the decision was handed to the monsters.

The curtain on the stage was pulled up. Members of the orchestra in uniforms emerged. The ensemble was made up of people from different races as they held their preferred instruments. Some looked like humans, others looked like beasts. There was a lot of variety. Everyone’s face was filled with confidence and pride in their instruments.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1707"><span class="indent">A halfling came to the front, likely the conductor, and bowed deeply to the audience—I recalled this young man sighing that he couldn’t do anything. I told him as comfort that “There’s no such thing.” Even though he wasn’t good at accounting, his weak physique made him unsuited for construction work and he wasn’t cut out for farming either. When out of options, he went to be enlisted, but he couldn’t win in a fight either.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1708"><span class="indent">While this was the case, he was good at raising morale. His singing voice was most beautiful and united the people. That’s when I recommended him to the army band. I had even given him the name “Taktstock”—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1709"><span class="indent">Taktstock then raised his face. Unlike his expression from before, his face was now filled with enthusiasm. As he graciously subjected himself to the judging eyes of the high nobles, he turned his little back to everyone. A small and fragile body, but his back was full of strength.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1710"><span class="indent">Everything happened so quickly. These people were lucky that their talents were developed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1711"><span class="indent">He raised his taktstock (conductor baton), and the next second—they began to perform. A steady tone started, and soon was followed by a change into a solemn reprise.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1712"><span class="indent">Under the conduction of Taktstock, the performers were acting in unison. They had also found things to be proud of. The music they were performing seemed to be announcing: “This is the best moment of my life.” It was mesmerizing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1713"><span class="italic indent">Classical music, these are famous songs that can be recognized in any era no matter where.

I guess this was to be expected. The audience were all hearing these songs for the first time. They had no clue where they were from.

Naturally, people wouldn’t suspect a thing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1728"><span class="indent">Whether it was people who were used to listening to famous songs or not, they all probably heard these songs for the first time, and some were really into them.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1729"><span class="indent">The orchestra’s music surrounded and dominated the music theatre, the people in the audience didn’t even risk making a sound by blinking; they were fully concentrated.

It was large enough for 50,000 people and had a roof that stuck out over the audience seats, which was used for sun-screening. It had a semi-circular shape, much like a pterosaur’s wing membrane over the wing bone.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2234"><span class="indent">To be honest, this design was mainly due to my personal preference. I wanted to make the atmosphere a bit creepier and deliberately designed it this way. The intended purpose of it was to block out the sun, but no one really believed that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2235"><span class="indent">People cried out, were scared, and raised their heads to see it. But there were nonetheless some weirdos who seemed very excited. The audience was crowding all over the place and all of the seats were occupied. The sheer turnout was all thanks to <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s invitations. He was truly amazing. While there was much disappointment and stress last night, the man was still very reliable.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2236"><span class="indent">The audience seats surrounded an empty area, which we had prepared as the stage for battle. After processing a selection of giant rocks, we embedded them in this empty lot. We first compressed the hard rock into a cube, two meters in length. We then arranged them carefully as a base. The slits between the blocks were filled with a sticky buffer material, making them, as a whole, look like one giant, flat rock plate.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2237"><span class="indent">Since there wasn’t enough time, I also constructed a part of it. Normal, hard rocks were already three hundred times harder than cement, and with magicules infused into the rock base of the colosseum, it became ten thousand times that. It was two meters thick alone, and its hardness put nuclear blast shelters to shame.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2238"><span class="indent">I hadn’t done any real testing, but I was certain it should survive a direct nuclear magic strike without a crack. Not to mention that the physical layer was also reinforced by a magical enchantment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2239"><span class="indent">Beyond that, we’d set up a double-layer defense barrier. The first layer covered the entire ground. It went all the way to the spectator seats in a large-scale magic circle. In order for it to withstand <span data-term="Hinata" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s future battle training, I made sure it was impenetrable from the get-go.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2240"><span class="indent">The second barrier stretched around the inner circumference of the seating, right in front of the first row of benches where the audience sat, extending in a diameter of around fifty meters. The battleground was above the two magic circles.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2241"><span class="indent">The double barrier was meant to protect the venue and prevent the audience from being impacted by the event. The first barrier would halt magicules from flowing through, but posed no restrictions on Skill usage. Therefore, if someone were to launch a powerful magic attack, it could still impact the surroundings. So just in case, we set up the second barrier. And, worst-case scenario, I could just launch ‘Absolute Defense’ of ‘<span data-term="Covenant King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Uriel’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2242"><span class="indent">While I didn’t want anyone to see me using the Skill, it was better than having my guests get hurt. I would activate it the instant there was an issue, so no one would find out. There definitely wasn’t gonna be a problem since we did it so discreetly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2243"><span class="indent">Honestly, I was pretty sure the double-layer barrier alone would do the trick. It was one thing if my lieutenants were to join in the battle, but the abilities of the contestants alone were hardly enough to wreck the place. At least that’s what I thought, but I didn’t expect the “Chosen Hero” <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to have joined in…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2244"><span class="indent">The venue was packed with excited onlookers.

Some people would climb atop roofs or poles, trying to catch a glimpse from above the ground. But they probably couldn’t see much given the long distance.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2248"><span class="indent">By contrast, the Colosseum in our nation had rings of benches installed in incremental heights along a slope, which allowed for a larger number of spectators. As a bonus, we had installed giant screens to live stream the battle for people in the audience to view from all four directions.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2249"><span class="indent">With the light magic engravings, it was extremely easy to enlarge a projection of the match. Some guests seemed to recognize the same device that was used during yesterday’s tech presentation. They did seem pretty interested in the device, so I predicted that it would have a pretty decent promotional effect.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2250"><span class="indent">In this way, we could slowly move towards success by attracting clients and building a strong foundation. This was the same technique I used when I was doing a nine-to-five job.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2251"><span class="indent">That was why the guests were able to see the stage clearly.

It seemed that besides ‘Fusion’ and ‘Ability Change’, it could also reverse ‘King of Gluttony’ and ‘Food Chain’ to grant individual abilities. However, the conditions were apparently very strict, as it took adaptability into account, among many other things. That being said, Raphael-sensei still wanted to do an experiment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2296"><span class="indent">Sure, I nodded and answered “YES” in my heart, and then…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2297"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Report.

Its ability to control wasn’t particularly great, so it was not a very useful power.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2302"><span class="indent">But if the two confronting parties had a certain difference in strength, they could forcefully drag the opponents into a new space to gain an edge against them. But that really depended on how the users applied their skills. On the other hand, it also depended on their opponents’ ability. It wouldn’t work if they were on par with themselves, but they could try to trick their opponents, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2303"><span class="indent">If they were to create a special space with rules such as restraining magic use—hmm, that would make an interesting idea of applying it. In that way, it could be used as a ‘Defensive Barrier’ to lower the attack power of the enemies as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2304"><span class="indent">Since they would be working inside the labyrinth, they could also negotiate with the adventurers by adding conditions such as giving additional treasure, etc. Now that they had even mastered skills like this, the two were becoming more and more like dungeon bosses.

This was largely due to him observing the hard work of his father as he grew. While the former king still ruled the nation, Gazel was having the time of his life during the last free period of his life. Apparently, it was then that he met <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Elmesia.

I couldn’t see it, but that was not the case for Elmesia. Picking up on people’s actual feelings was a piece of cake for the royal court. That’s why they were constantly wearing masks and deceiving each other cautiously… Looks like I needed to call Gazel my mentor in that regard, yet Elmesia was still treating him like an infant. No wonder why Gazel’s face was filled with disgust.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2921"><span class="indent">Elmesia then exclaimed, “Let me have a drink as well,” as she took a glass of fruit wine from <span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

The two looked quite tacit, but they were both no different than children in Elmesia’s eyes, perhaps that’s why they were similar.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2923"><span class="indent">But of course, also myself, who’s inexperienced had no chance of winning in a negotiation with Elmesia. That’s why Gazel told me to forget about it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2924"><span class="indent">“Ara, this tastes good as well.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2925"><span class="indent">“You are too kind.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2926"><span class="indent">The fruit wine poured by <span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have fit her appetite, filling her face with an even brighter smile.

If she were to dislike it, it would be difficult to prepare anything better. I was a little relieved as Gazel spoke up once more with emphasis.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2927"><span class="indent">“Alright, that’s enough. Time is precious, I’m afraid there’s none to waste on your little hobbies.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2928"><span class="indent">After his hurrying again, Elmesia was finally willing to talk business.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2929"><span class="indent">“Alright.

The contrast of her behavior seemed to be too drastic, perhaps I had misjudged her. But since she liked the lively time of celebration and talking about participating in said projects, it was right down my alley.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2934"><span class="indent">“Royalties are not slaves to the people.

I am glad that someone is on my side, I’ll be looking forward to encountering you in the future.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2936"><span class="indent">I shook hands with Elmesia with a smile. Now Elmesia was my comrade.

Even though Gazel and <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were shivering, seemingly sighting omens, we simply did not care.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2937"><span class="indent">And then Elmesia took out her magic wallet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2938"><span class="indent">“I only have some pocket changes with me, at most one thousand gold coins.

I can only say that her concept of money is a bit weird. Looks like she’s an authentic billionaire, it was the right choice to listen to Gazel’s words and not make her an enemy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2941"><span class="indent">“Alright, just remember to fulfill your promise.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2942"><span class="indent">“Of course!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2943"><span class="indent">I nodded with a smile at Elmesia’s response.

Delta was flying around tirelessly trying to catch up with him. She was a semi-spiritual life form (half spirit, half living being), able to use ‘Teleportation’ via the vegetation. However, doing so would disrupt the live video feed she was supposed to relay. That must’ve been why she was trying so hard to keep pace with Kai by flying after him. Her dedication and enthusiasm towards her work was truly commendable. Despite Delta struggling, with the fear of falling behind, Kai couldn’t have cared less, instead keeping up his steady pace while dashing through hallway after hallway. He kept on sprinting towards the stairs without ever getting lost, he appeared to be using magic or other means to gain knowledge of his surroundings.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3779"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Answer. It is the effect of Elemental Magic “Map Generation”.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3780"><span class="indent">So, you could also do that when you didn’t have a map at hand. It seemed to be the type of magic used by ‘Great <span data-term="Sage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ in the past. Magic like that could generate information about locations in his brain, that is, if he could cast the magic consistently. It seemed that not only was he skilled in the sword, he was also good with magic. He sure had some tricks up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3781"><span class="indent">I did inquire about him from Fuze, and it turned out that Kai was indeed the rare A Rank personnel. No wonder he had abilities like that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3782"><span class="indent">He was currently tearing through the second floor and would be reaching the stairs soon. At this rate, it would take him another two hours before he reached the fifth floor. That was a lot faster than I expected, I never anticipated their progress to be so fast.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3783"><span class="indent">There’s something else that was bothering me however—it was Kai’s unusual expression. His mouth was twisted grotesquely, and his eyes were bloodshot…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3784"><span class="indent">By the time he reached the third floor, he hadn’t shown any signs of slowing down either. But unlike the first and second floors, he wasn’t even skipping a single small room—he was checking for treasure chests. Or perhaps it was the opposite case—he seemed to know where the treasure chests were at and was able to find the rooms with treasure chests effortlessly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3785"><span class="indent">He was also only picking the silver chests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3786"><span class="indent">“This <span data-term="guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]}|</span>… How’s he doing that?” I muttered to myself. Raphael-sensei didn’t respond.

Is he perhaps the type that can even sniff out money?” Ramiris commented coldly, while I understood somewhat.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3788"><span class="indent">In any case, Kai was definitely not any ordinary person.

There’s another room here as well.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3796"><span class="indent">One of his companions discovered the door on accident.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3797"><span class="indent">“Could this be another trap?” Basson asked, his face filled with doubts.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3798"><span class="indent">Just now, they had been battling the trapped treasure chests filled with paralyzing toxin and sleeping gas. There was also a rather weak mimic they fought. They had developed PTSD from treasure chests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3799"><span class="indent">“Oi, Ramiris. What’s in the room of that treasure chest? If this continues, it won’t have any good promotional effect, even I am starting to feel sorry for them, so it’s about time for them to get something good…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3800"><span class="indent">How should I put it, seeing how these people were getting tricked reminded me of the gacha game I played, and the sour memory of ten rolls of absolute garbage. After getting all that trash before, their misfortune weighed even on me. If they ended up losing their motivation, they wouldn’t be coming back in the future… That’s why I thought it was about time to give them some grand prize.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3801"><span class="indent">“D-don’t worry. It was because those challengers sucked… Although it’s not fair for me to say so, I really didn’t expect them to be that reckless. B-but that room has one monster and a silver chest. I don’t remember what was in it, but they will definitely get something good this time!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3802"><span class="italic indent">Fine, that should do it. I hope they will encounter at least something nice today—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3803"><span class="indent">“AHH! It’s a trap again, there’s even a monster in here!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3804"><span class="indent">“Tsk, how about we retreat for now?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3805"><span class="indent">“We can’t, Basson. It’s already onto us!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3806"><span class="indent">“It’s a great-bear! It won’t be easy for us to escape…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3807"><span class="indent">The two sides were already staring at each other, observing what sort of move they would be making.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3808"><span class="italic indent">—Eh, what is this?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3809"><span class="indent">Only one monster appeared, there’s no way you needed to panic like that. There was only a slim chance for a monster to already appear on the first floor, and there wouldn’t be any strong ones on the second floor either. Yet this hidden room had a silver chest containing some quality reward. A strong monster was deployed to guard this chest… This hidden grand prize on the second floor.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3810"><span class="indent">Yet it only had a great-bear, a measly Rank C monster. Basson’s team, with a combined strength of Ranked B, could easily take care of them. Despite this, Basson and Gomez were shocked upon seeing the great-bear.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3811"><span class="indent">“Basson-aniki, there’s a treasure chest there!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3812"><span class="indent">“It’s silver.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3813"><span class="indent">“It may be trapped again, but all we can do now is fight. Alright everyone, get ready!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3814"><span class="indent">“Copy that!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3815"><span class="indent">“Let’s go, let’s go!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3816"><span class="indent">It seemed that Basson’s six-man team finally made up their mind to fight. As they were staring at the great-bear, the team carefully raised their weapons.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3817"><span class="indent">“I’ll be the bait; you <span data-term="guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]}|</span>s take the chance and attack!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3818"><span class="indent">Basson really had the composure of a leader, he’d decided to be a competent tank. He rushed into the room and shouted, diverting all of the great-bear’s attention to him.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3819"><span class="indent">Basson and the great-bear confronted each other face-to-face.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3820"><span class="indent">“Oh! Basson’s party appears to be engaging a monster in battle! Their opponent is a great-bear? I heard that one swing of its giant paw can easily take someone’s life—”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3821"><span class="indent">I finally realized my mistake after hearing <span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3822"><span class="italic indent">Right, this isn’t actually a video game.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3823"><span class="indent">Basson and his men were, after all, professional adventurers. They didn’t want any of their men to be injured. Even the slightest misstep could have cost them their lives, and so they would most definitely avoid fighting monsters that yielded no profit. Even though they didn’t really need to worry about dying in there, it would take some time for people to actually accept such a mindset.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3824"><span class="italic indent">With that in mind, perhaps I should re-evaluate how I’ve been trying to promote the labyrinth…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3825"><span class="indent">And soon, the battle began.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3826"><span class="indent">Basson lunged forward to take on the great-bear’s attack. A look of desperation was etched on his face. The only thing between him and the monster was a worn-out piece of leather armor. A piece that didn’t cover up his entire body and left his hands and lower sides completely exposed. He found himself in quite the precarious situation despite confronting an opponent weaker than himself. His great axe could land heavy chopping blows, yet it was not suitable to defend against a bear’s claws. That’s why Basson had been using his round shield to deflect the great-bear’s paw.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3827"><span class="indent">His companions, on the other hand, were covering for Basson. To keep themselves safe, they were targeting the eyes and feet of the great-bear when launching attacks. The magician named Gomez, meanwhile, launched the great-magic spell Wind Slash to take its life.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3828"><span class="indent">“And it’s at this moment that their battle to the death with the great-bear concludes! An excellent fight!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3829"><span class="indent">“Indeed. Their actions were very logical and devoid of unnecessary complications. That was the style of experienced fighters.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3830"><span class="indent">As I listened to <span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s broadcast, I mulled over the fight just now. Indeed, their teamwork was flawless. In the end, there were no casualties in Basson’s team, and they took around five minutes to take down the great-bear.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3831"><span class="indent">But I couldn’t shake off the troubles as new problems started to emerge.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3832"><span class="indent">“Oi oi oi, I didn’t expect them to fight so cautiously against an enemy far weaker than themselves…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3833"><span class="indent">“Um—I was surprised too. But shouldn’t that normally be the case?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3834"><span class="indent">“I suppose. Although not having drawn a map is indicative of poor performance, we seem to have underestimated their abilities.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3835"><span class="indent">“That’s true, maybe it will take three days just to break through the first floor alone…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3836"><span class="indent">“Um—if that’s the case, we should really think about quantifying the rations…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3837"><span class="indent">I didn’t expect our project to be disrupted by something like this.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3838"><span class="indent">Basson’s team had teammates of varying ranks, but their overall strength was the equivalent of Rank B. As for Basson and Gomez, with their good equipment, they may have been around Rank B in terms of skill. Yet we couldn’t have anticipated that such a six-man team had to struggle in a fight on the second floor already.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3839"><span class="indent">In terms of results alone, it was their complete victory, though taking five minutes was perhaps way too long. However, as professional adventurers, they might also value safety more…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3840"><span class="indent">Maybe they should be taught to adapt different fighting strategies, perhaps they could adhere to the strategy of “Use healing potions even if it’s only a scratch” to improve their combat efficiency.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3841"><span class="indent">Not sure why I was worried, but right now Basson’s party was approaching the treasure chest.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3842"><span class="indent">“It looks like the room contained a treasure chest, it looks silver as well, what could possibly be inside…?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3843"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words had tensed up the audience. While the other teams had opened treasure chests several times by now, people were still highly interested in the instant that they were opened.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3844"><span class="indent">One of Basson’s teammates went up and immediately threw the lid open.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3845"><span class="italic indent">Oi oi oi, shouldn’t you at least check for traps?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3846"><span class="indent">Silver chests weren’t set with traps, but Basson’s team had no clue of that. Just before this, they had gotten poisoned with paralysis and enveloped with sleeping gas. They also seemed to be taking turns when opening chests, but this wasn’t a punishment game… Their crude way of opening the chest even put me, as a spectator, on edge.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3847"><span class="indent">In this regard, in the eyes of me, an epic gamer, I could only call them amateurs.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3848"><span class="indent">Having treasure chests inside labyrinths was a foreign concept to people here… is that why they were so quick to do something so reckless? From this point of view, <span data-term="Elen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party was at least somewhat better. Their team had Gido, who, so far, had ensured that they wouldn’t trigger any traps while extracting items from treasure chests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3849"><span class="indent">Basson’s team’s issue probably came down to them not having a thief. Professional adventurers that exterminated monsters were probably the buff type who weren’t suited for situations like this. They should have hired teammates specializing in exploration.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3850"><span class="italic indent">Hold up?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3851"><span class="indent">It may be that the difficulty of the labyrinth was higher than we expected. I thought that the issue was Basson’s party not being professional enough, but it would seem that a lot of people were simply not good at exploring a labyrinth. Their walkthrough couldn’t be made faster.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3852"><span class="indent">I needed to reflect on the issue.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3853"><span class="indent">“OH, WOWOWO! Basson-aniki, it’s a sword!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3854"><span class="italic indent">NICU!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3855"><span class="indent">They seemed to have hit the jackpot. Moreover, the rare-grade jackpot deluxe. There were many different types of rewards, such as high-grade healing potions, ancient gold coins, or fine quality gear etc. We also designed it so that, starting from level two, there would be a very low chance of the reward being a rare-grade item.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3856"><span class="indent">What Basson got was a rare-grade sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3857"><span class="indent">“By the way, Mentor said that all of the treasure chests were designed to have higher reward drop rates!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3858"><span class="indent">“I-is that so? But so far they have been getting shit rewards all around…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3859"><span class="indent">It was rare for Veldora to be so generous, yet it was ruined by Basson’s bad luck. No, had Veldora not raised the probability, they could have been getting shit gear even now.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3860"><span class="indent">With that being said, obtaining this rare-grade sword was a game-changer for them. This would be great for publicity. Basson’s team would probably also want to test their luck even more. Upon thinking so, I had to compliment Veldora with a “Good job”.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3861"><span class="indent">“For Veldora, this decision has been amazing. If you failed to leave these folks with some good memories, it would affect the future of the labyrinth exploration.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3862"><span class="italic indent">I’ll thank Veldora later.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3863"><span class="indent">Basson’s men whistled upon laying eyes on the sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3864"><span class="indent">They seemed to be very fond of the treasure.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3865"><span class="indent">“You <span data-term="guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]}|</span>s, let’s keep on going at this pace!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3866"><span class="indent">Basson sheathed his great axe and changed his weapon to the sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3867"><span class="indent">In the next room, three Rank D bats appeared, all cut down by him in one smooth slash. The quality of the sword had perhaps added a bonus to their overall effectiveness, they seemed to have become faster in dealing with enemies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3868"><span class="indent">This was a sword crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciple. It barely made it to the level of rare-grade, however, to Basson’s party, it was a mighty sword, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3869"><span class="indent">Kai was no exception in this regard. I heard that even the elite of Rank A had difficulty in gathering a full set of rare-grade gear. No wonder why Basson and his boys were so happy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3870"><span class="indent">As if they were making up for their previous losses, the party pushed forward confidently. In addition, they also seemed to have obtained many “Magic Crystals” from the monsters.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3871"><span class="indent">“This sword is really nice, now we’re making some profit. We may make more money than we expected.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3872"><span class="indent">“That’s right, when this labyrinth is officially opened, we gotta come back for more!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3873"><span class="indent">They chatted joyfully.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3874"><span class="indent">And so, Basson’s party continued their walkthrough—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3875"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3876"><span class="indent">Let’s have a look at <span data-term="Elen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.app.capitalCase(this.parentNode.dataset.term)]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s team.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3877"><span class="indent">They were staying on the first floor, where it was difficult to find rare-grade gear. These folks were operating cautiously with safety in mind. One could say that they were overly cautious.

With less than an hour left, they seemed to have set their minds on achieving their goal.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3883"><span class="indent">Their reason for staying on the first floor for that long was apparently to collect potions.

That’s because Delta had severed Kai’s head from his body with her slim finger.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3997"><span class="indent">Kai really had picked the wrong opponent when choosing to fight against Delta. He was indeed of Rank A ability, but Delta was a dryad. Although she didn’t have combat experience, by her racial instinct alone, she had already exceeded Hazard-class.

There was no way someone like Kai could win.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3998"><span class="indent">The audience couldn’t help but feel shaken to see that Kai, the active participant during the tournament, was taken down by the nice lady Delta.

However, he had been in a coma since. After all, the punishment this time had a lot more punch to it. Delta utilized her special authority to restrict the function of the “Revival Bracelet”.

On the other hand, this moment served to educate people on what would happen if you didn’t adhere to the rules.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4018"><span class="indent">And so, I was personally rather satisfied by the outcome of Kai’s run.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4019"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_4020"><span class="indent">***</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4021"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4022"><span class="indent">The current situation was that most teams had finished exploring the labyrinth, with Basson’s party still remaining.

Or more precisely, the rather engaging fight, visible on the big screen, had made them immerse themselves in the scene as well. Every time a monster showed up, it was met with screams and yelps from the audience. Such reactions were quite interesting.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4029"><span class="indent">Perhaps it was like watching a horror movie. When someone died, there were even people lamenting, as if they were at the scene.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4030"><span class="indent">It may be just as interesting of an event to broadcast the exploration of the labyrinth itself. Although playing any footage would probably cause some issues, we should perhaps try to negotiate with adventurers challenging the labyrinth regarding the rights to play their footage.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4031"><span class="indent">And just like that, I came up with this small idea.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4032"><span class="indent">By the time I snapped out of my thoughts, the time was almost over.
