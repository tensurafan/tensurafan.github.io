As someone who had lived their whole life as a nobleman, it would be hard for Kazak to adapt his lifestyle.

There was a need for a large and powerful country like Dwargon to show its majesty to the nobles of other countries that would be visiting the festival.

That was the surprising discovery of the ancient ruins called “Soma”.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_726"><span class="indent">With this outstanding feat under her belt, Kagali-san’s reputation was revised in the public eye.

Even if it’s just to make meaningful use of the past, I think we should show our respect to the ancient people.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_755"><span class="indent">Well, those were probably just my overly emotional thoughts.

But that raised the question—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_857"><span class="indent">“That’s it. We need to find someone to be a good teacher for those kids, right? But if it’s someone stronger than Clouse, he would need to be an active A rank.

There was a large number of nobles attending, each garbed in luxurious and flashy clothing.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1004"><span class="indent">Looking at the ratio between men and women, I felt like there were a couple more men. It seemed like we were afforded a considerable amount of trust, considering how many brought their wife and kids as well. Among them I saw a cute blonde-haired girl, who looked like a doll. There were attendees of all different ages, it seemed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1005"><span class="indent">This time people could participate freely, leading me to put a lot of effort into this being a fun party. It was arranged so that the people can enjoy meals while standing, with various dishes placed on buffet tables for guests to enjoy as they strolled around.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1006"><span class="indent">Additionally, we had set up curiosities that were unheard of in any other country. Among them was a “tatami room,” which covered half of the wide space, and where it was prohibited to wear your shoes. In many countries it wasn’t customary to take off your shoes, therefore I only saw people enter from time to time. But it wasn’t like it remained deserted, I could occasionally witness people sitting down and getting flustered by the unfamiliar sitting cushions—King Gazel was one of them. It wasn’t his first time experiencing this, so he seemed quite at home, and we chatted for a brief moment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1007"><span class="indent">I was told that he inspected the city’s developmental situation this morning, and things like the sewage system, as well as the work-in-progress rails, caught his eye.

Since it’s a request from my adorable junior, gladly—how could I ever refuse?” King Gazel announced his decision on the spot.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1011"><span class="indent">He probably weighed the benefits after laying eyes on the rails and saw the potential. If he were this enthusiastic about it, he would likely have disregarded a “no” and vehemently insisted on joining the project, leaving me little choice, other than bringing him on board straight away.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1012"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1013"><span class="indent">During my discussion about it with Gazel, a man came up, saying, “Excuse me,” and sat down at the seat facing me. A familiar face—it was <span data-term="Youm" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

I saw a new side of him.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1018"><span class="italic indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1019"><span class="indent">There were those who went ahead and experienced the large bathhouse before the eve of the festival. Most deemed it favorable and had asked many questions to the one in charge of the bathhouse. I heard there were large bathhouses in other big countries, though many found the hot spring itself to be breathtaking. The ingredients providing the medicinal effects were a tightly guarded secret, severely hampering attempts to reproduce it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1020"><span class="indent">I had received copious requests, asking us to introduce them to their countries as well, but I decided to gather and file those guests’ requests for later review.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1021"><span class="indent">That said, all I could tell them was to please visit us often.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1022"><span class="indent">Among the people who were satisfied after soaking in the bath, several were now sitting in the tatami room with a Yukata we provided them. It painted a dignified image, with them throwing glances at each other in admiration of the outfits.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1023"><span class="indent">In the midst of this, there were people who wanted to speak to me one-on-one, though talking with everyone would’ve stretched me too thinly, so I only met those I encountered at a fortunate time, and proceeded to make my way across to sit in the seat of honor.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1024"><span class="indent">Many people were seeing me for the first time, so, understandably, I could feel a lot of curious looks being thrown at me. From those who turned pale, knowing I was a <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and on the other hand, those who observed me attentively, it was a mixed bag. Their prickling gazes were unnerving, so I greeted them lightly and immediately announced the start of the banquet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1025"><span class="indent">“Ah, it is a pleasure for me to welcome you here today. I am <span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Rimuru. I would prefer for this night to be free of serious topics, and instead would like to direct you towards our nation’s dishes that I hope you will enjoy. Long speeches are not my strength, so please excuse me for cutting it short. I wish you all a grand time; let the party begin!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1026"><span class="indent">The preparation was perfect. The way we served the dishes was the cherry on top. I hoped our sincerity could be conveyed fully.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1027"><span class="indent">Each table had a waitress assigned and Vester strictly educated them to bring dishes with every request. Everything was laid out to serve the guests—the results of intense education and training were now on full display.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1028"><span class="indent">I called for a toast after I finished my greeting.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1029"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1030"><span class="indent">The eve of the festival had been set in motion.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1031"><span class="indent">Gasps swept through the crowds as they all drank a glass of cold beer. Tempest’s beer must have been surprising to those who had only tried poorly carbonated drinks before. After all, they were kept freezing cold.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1032"><span class="indent">The method of preparing a cold glass cup, was something taught by the meticulous style of Japanese service. Even for my own sake, it wasn’t something I could compromise on.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1033"><span class="indent">Not only that, but elven ladies were pouring alcohol. It wasn’t forced, you know? I only accepted those who voluntarily offered to help.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1034"><span class="indent">This was another huge success. Beautiful elven ladies were roaming around the banquet hall carrying various kinds of alcoholic beverages. Those who were accustomed to wearing formal dress seemed to be enraptured by the Yukata adorned elves’ voluptuous figures. In addition, the way the elves greeted the guests by putting three fingers on the floor, shook the hearts of men equally among all nations. I could see their faces turn red even when they weren’t drunk. The view of the elves’ chests, laid bare behind the Yukata, must’ve been an alluring sight.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1035"><span class="italic indent">Hehehe. Like I intended.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1036"><span class="indent">I would say that this was the pinnacle of merging western and Japanese traditional culture. The heterogenous mixture of those clad in Yukatas among the nobles wearing formal attire made for quite the scene—it was something you could only see here.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1037"><span class="indent">That was what we planned, but, nonetheless, it ended up being a wildly chaotic party. From a commonsense standpoint, this really looked like a mess. But if this bothered you, then you had already lost.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1038"><span class="indent">I acted as if this was the norm and observed the condition of the guests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1039"><span class="indent">The extravagant dishes on the tables were made by <span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Yoshida, who went through a lot of effort to create delectable meals, and I could confidently say that the guests would all be satisfied with them. Smoked chicken-duck meat and sandwiches filled with vegetables, cow-deer steak, fried vegetables marinated in sauce, karaage fried chicken, roast beef salad.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1040"><span class="indent">We also prepared a sherbet made with an assortment of fruits as refreshments, and going so far as to recreate dishes like the black tiger meat stew and grilled fairy-leather bird from the Walpurgis banquet. Although we had quite a hard time looking for the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> we could use as ingredients, we were somehow able to track them down within three days, using the information we had gathered before.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1041"><span class="indent">We were able to satisfy the aristocrats, who were accustomed to luxury, with the dishes made from precious ingredients that were the pride of our country.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1042"><span class="indent">That wasn’t all. In the banquet hall, at the dividing line between the Japanese traditional space and the western space, a large fish was being carted in. It was a fish with an extremely hard exoskeleton and a sharp, spear-like horn. This abominable ocean <span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was called a “spear tuna”, and, excluding the horn, had grown to four meters in length of heinous-looking fish.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1043"><span class="indent">Now, the reason why we brought this fish. It had, in fact, a delicious, savory taste to all of that blubber, which was unthinkable, based solely on its appearance. Under the armor-like exoskeleton, red meat that looked similar to tuna was hidden.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1044"><span class="indent">I actually caught the fish by coincidence during the course of a competitive fishing match, which <span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I had placed bets on, and, fortunately, I thought to use ‘</span><span class="indent"><span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span></span><span class="indent">’ before tossing it away. It was found to have non-toxic and highly nutritious meat. I dipped it in our commercially available soy sauce before giving it a try, and…it was exceptionally delicious.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1045"><span class="indent">I remembered this savory treat and decided to unveil it before everyone at the banquet, so I went out by myself and caught one. I was used to traveling under water, so it was a great experience. But we’d have someone else catch it next time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1046"><span class="indent">So anyway, the fish was a recent catch and still fresh.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1047"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Hakurou" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was responsible for cutting the fish, and using the long kitchen knife <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had forged, he made us sashimi previously.

The spear tuna was dismembered in a beautiful display of artistic skill.

Just think of her as a beast who’s been through all sorts of hardships.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1165"><span class="indent">I took Gazel’s insistent words to heart and prepared myself for an abnormal encounter. I looked at Gazel and nodded firmly to show that I understood.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1166"><span class="indent">A great commotion broke loose inside the parlor house. Someone who you normally could never meet, no, not only that, the empress of a superpower, who had not shown herself for tens of years, appeared. I should say it was natural for others to be causing a ruckus.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1167"><span class="indent">Empress Elmesia <span data-term="Elaure" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Sarion. Someone who called herself a divine empress, was confidently walking into the venue. An incarnation of beauty, was the thought passing through everyone’s head as they gawked, bereft of words, at Empress Elmesia.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1168"><span class="indent">I thought that as well. Because that appearance, no matter from which angle you looked, she was a beautiful girl. She had skin as white as freshly fallen snow, and soft, silver hair. Sharp, pointy ears and jade green eyes that seemed to see through everything.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1169"><span class="indent">Gazel said she was a girl, so she definitely had to be female.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1170"><span class="indent">If she was a <span data-term="high elf" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, then did that mean she was a pure-blooded fairy? Or she might’ve had blood that was infinitely close to pure. Calling her a fairy addresses too broad of a category, but they were said to be a race that evolved from great spirits, so this Elmesia standing before me seemed to be one of those ancient beasts from a time long gone. She was a big enough deal to warrant a warning from Gazel.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1171"><span class="indent">I also needed to remain vigilant of the guardians protecting the Empress. From each and every one, I felt extreme power, despite them wearing formal garments. It must’ve been magic armor, and this was just my guess, but they were legendary-grade. The power I felt emanating from those formal clothes was equivalent to the feeling I got from the Moonlight rapier <span data-term="Hinata" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wielded.

It was simply her voice being that charming.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1176"><span class="indent">“I, too, am honored to meet you,” I answered in front of her, at which point I could see my own reflection in Elmesia’s jade green eyes.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1177"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Notice. ‘Mind Interference’ detected—Interrupted.

I expect a lot from the festival that will take place tomorrow, so please make me happy. And—” she said with a leisurely smile, then brought her face near mine, and whispered in a hushed voice only I could hear, “It doesn’t have to be today, but I hope you can make time for me. There’s something I’d like to discuss with an open heart, in a less formal setting.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1182"><span class="indent">That informal way of speaking must’ve been Elmesia’s true self.

I continued:</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1536"><span class="indent">“Some may be wary of the fact that I am a <span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. While this sense of caution is understandable, I hope everyone would put trust into your genuine feelings. I won’t force you to accept my views.

However, how the people interpreted my message was entirely up to them. Next, I addressed the royal ruling classes:</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1538"><span class="indent">“Fellow nobles gathered today, I hope that you will relay what you see and hear here today honestly when you return to your respective nations.

An indecisive ruler will only bring about harm, especially for innocent civilians.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1543"><span class="indent">After all, ensuring the lives and properties of our citizens was the responsibility of the state.

A world without military conflict was nothing but an idealistic dream. A citizen had every freedom and right to dream about peace and prosperity, but that wasn’t a luxury rulers could afford. They needed to always be on their feet, ready to handle any situation that may arise. This was the bare minimum for a nation to function. That was my justification for the speech I just delivered to the higher-class guests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1544"><span class="indent">And to wrap it all up—</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1545"><span class="indent">“Whether you’re a merchant, adventurer, or peasant, I swear not to lay my hands on common civilians.

Naturally, with more people come more opportunities. Here, you will have freedom of speech and the ability to choose the occupation that you desire. But even so, please speak and act responsibly. If you are still interested in our nation after my speech, please consider my proposition. There are all sorts of events planned for our nation in the future as well. Today’s Tempest <span data-term="Founding Festival" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is but the first debut project.

My citizens aside, even the visitors were in an uproar. Although there must also be people who still had their suspicions, most people were willing to trust me and put their faith in this nation.

This was…umm, a genuine observation even from other people’s point of view. While there was a relatively high artistic and musical achievement, that was limited to royalty and nobility. They were entertainment for the upper echelon that had both an abundance of money and time. The angels would assault any city that developed past a certain threshold. As a result, most aspects of advanced culture were tucked away in the realms of the privileged. To the nobles, these forms of culture were merely considered as minor entertainment. But to me, culture was something that required a collective effort to build together.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1694"><span class="indent">Geniuses had been buried in this world. It was not only difficult to discover the genius in these fields in a world with such a narrow view, but they may also even be buried and eventually not be developed for their entire lives.

I followed Rigurd to guide the guests who had yet to calm themselves from the exciting experience in the morning.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1786"><span class="indent">Just passing by the opera house, we moved towards the museum this time. It felt as if we had gotten to the wrong place, but the historical records room was our destination this time.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1787"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta were welcoming us at the entrance of the building. Some of the guests seemed to be aware that Vesta used to be a subject of the Dwarven Kingdom. A wave of noise came through, sounded like a commotion of surprise. But Vesta didn’t seem to mind as he laughed alongside the crowd.

It was at this point that I discovered a misstep. While Vesta’s explanation was in detail, it was probably pretty boring to the people without the relevant knowledge. It was possibly for this reason that some had begun to feel bored.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1791"><span class="indent">The arrangement of the event was not ideal either. Had the tech presentation been arranged in the morning, the crowd would probably still attend out of curiosity. And it would appear less tedious. But arranging it right after the amazing concert in the morning, the presentation in comparison would, therefore, be dull. Moreover, considering that most of the guests are aristocrats, they may have been interested in the outcomes, but the production process would appear less significant. This must’ve been on their minds. Vesta seemed to have noticed this as well, as a wry smile emerged on his face.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1792"><span class="indent">“My, my, it must be tedious for everyone to listen to these abstruse topics.

While such a reaction was expected, they were really being noisy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1807"><span class="indent">But I could understand their sentiments. However, regarding the application range of the healing potion… Of course it was not limited to humans, it was effective for animals, plants and <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1808"><span class="italic indent">Then, what really is the difference?</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;Upon thinking so, that did make me ponder. </span><span class="italic indent">Is it a difference between being organic and inorganic?</span><span class="indent">&nbsp;No, my guess was that it had to do with having will or not.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1809"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;Answer.

Plants have wills as well. Although they have no clear concept of self, they still desire to live. But a sword does not have “Soul”, in other words, possesses no will.

The medicine made from it is the full healing potion.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1867"><span class="indent">They were displaying a series of images while hiding the key technology. Vesta also explained the production process of healing potions.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1868"><span class="indent">“Then there’s the leaves of the hipokute herbs. When you grind them up and mix in magicule, you can produce ointment that can be applied on wounds. However, its effect is not as obvious.

Even if we make them into herbs, as soon as our preservation method is not good enough, its effect would disappear. Moreover, compared to the juice of the healing potion, its effect is very low. Since these leftovers have always been prepared in one way, I’ve not paid any attention to it in the past.

After visiting the night market with <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rest, I went to visit the VIP Only Elven Cabaret at level 95 of the labyrinth for an inspection.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2222"><span class="indent">It was the top cabaret of our nation, designed and intended for VIP guests exclusively. However, for the sake of promoting our nation, we also opened it up for the other guests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2223"><span class="indent">And there it went. In the morning, people were still excited, unable to forget their concert experience. Some lost themselves in enthusiastic discussions regarding the capabilities of the healing potion.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2224"><span class="indent">Gazel and Vesta were there too. We, of course, couldn’t hide away from them and were forced to stay with them for quite a while. In the end, we had a great conversation and chatted until late over bottles of alcohol.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2225"><span class="indent">It felt great to be hearing compliments about my companions and having been overjoyed, I couldn’t help but want to get drunk. I was indeed reflecting at this point; I hope you guys can understand how I felt at the time. Besides, I wasn’t the only person who got wasted, so were the guests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2226"><span class="indent">All in all, they spent a lot of money at the cabaret. All the better for us. More good news: I had been discussing the matter of insufficient coins with a drunk Gazel when Duke <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> joined in, to which they agreed to consider aiding us. I supposed that was the power of alcohol.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2227"><span class="indent">&lt;&lt;……&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2228"><span class="indent">—Something like that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2229"><span class="indent">Already worn down a bit, we braced for the morning of the second day of the festival.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2230"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_2231"><span class="indent">***</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2232"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2233"><span class="indent">The recently finished Colosseum was a huge building. It was large enough for 50,000 people and had a roof that stuck out over the audience seats, which was used for sun-screening. It had a semi-circular shape, much like a pterosaur’s wing membrane over the wing bone.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2234"><span class="indent">To be honest, this design was mainly due to my personal preference. I wanted to make the atmosphere a bit creepier and deliberately designed it this way. The intended purpose of it was to block out the sun, but no one really believed that.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2235"><span class="indent">People cried out, were scared, and raised their heads to see it. But there were nonetheless some weirdos who seemed very excited. The audience was crowding all over the place and all of the seats were occupied. The sheer turnout was all thanks to <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s invitations. He was truly amazing. While there was much disappointment and stress last night, the man was still very reliable.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2236"><span class="indent">The audience seats surrounded an empty area, which we had prepared as the stage for battle. After processing a selection of giant rocks, we embedded them in this empty lot. We first compressed the hard rock into a cube, two meters in length. We then arranged them carefully as a base. The slits between the blocks were filled with a sticky buffer material, making them, as a whole, look like one giant, flat rock plate.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2237"><span class="indent">Since there wasn’t enough time, I also constructed a part of it. Normal, hard rocks were already three hundred times harder than cement, and with magicules infused into the rock base of the colosseum, it became ten thousand times that. It was two meters thick alone, and its hardness put nuclear blast shelters to shame.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2238"><span class="indent">I hadn’t done any real testing, but I was certain it should survive a direct nuclear magic strike without a crack. Not to mention that the physical layer was also reinforced by a magical enchantment.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2239"><span class="indent">Beyond that, we’d set up a double-layer defense barrier. The first layer covered the entire ground. It went all the way to the spectator seats in a large-scale magic circle. In order for it to withstand <span data-term="Hinata" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s future battle training, I made sure it was impenetrable from the get-go.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2240"><span class="indent">The second barrier stretched around the inner circumference of the seating, right in front of the first row of benches where the audience sat, extending in a diameter of around fifty meters. The battleground was above the two magic circles.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2241"><span class="indent">The double barrier was meant to protect the venue and prevent the audience from being impacted by the event. The first barrier would halt magicules from flowing through, but posed no restrictions on Skill usage. Therefore, if someone were to launch a powerful magic attack, it could still impact the surroundings. So just in case, we set up the second barrier. And, worst-case scenario, I could just launch ‘Absolute Defense’ of ‘<span data-term="Covenant King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Uriel’.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2242"><span class="indent">While I didn’t want anyone to see me using the Skill, it was better than having my guests get hurt. I would activate it the instant there was an issue, so no one would find out. There definitely wasn’t gonna be a problem since we did it so discreetly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2243"><span class="indent">Honestly, I was pretty sure the double-layer barrier alone would do the trick. It was one thing if my lieutenants were to join in the battle, but the abilities of the contestants alone were hardly enough to wreck the place. At least that’s what I thought, but I didn’t expect the “<span data-term="Chosen Hero" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” <span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to have joined in…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2244"><span class="indent">The venue was packed with excited onlookers. Go figure.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2245"><span class="indent">In this world, there weren’t a lot of entertainment events, so something like this would obviously cause a ruckus.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2246"><span class="indent">The martial tournament held in <span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom was already super popular. Every year, they would have adventurers of different ranks attending the tournament to fight for the championship.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2247"><span class="indent">However, our tournament differed slightly, as spectating it was open to average citizens as well. In <span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, only the wealthy got to partake as the audience, while the commoner had to wait for the results to be unveiled. Some people would climb atop roofs or poles, trying to catch a glimpse from above the ground. But they probably couldn’t see much given the long distance.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2248"><span class="indent">By contrast, the Colosseum in our nation had rings of benches installed in incremental heights along a slope, which allowed for a larger number of spectators. As a bonus, we had installed giant screens to live stream the battle for people in the audience to view from all four directions.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2249"><span class="indent">With the light magic engravings, it was extremely easy to enlarge a projection of the match. Some guests seemed to recognize the same device that was used during yesterday’s tech presentation. They did seem pretty interested in the device, so I predicted that it would have a pretty decent promotional effect.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2250"><span class="indent">In this way, we could slowly move towards success by attracting clients and building a strong foundation. This was the same technique I used when I was doing a nine-to-five job.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2251"><span class="indent">That was why the guests were able to see the stage clearly. They could also view the enlarged image on the screens.

All eight men stood in a line facing the VIP booth. All screens were showing the contestants’ faces, and even their expressions were clearly visible. These individuals all looked very distinct. By the way, some of these eight seemed quite familiar. Obviously, I had seen <span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span data-term="Geld" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2254"><span class="indent">Despite my being shocked by this, the introductions began without delay.

It was almost as if he was saying “Go ahead, bring on a new attack”.

Let’s put that aside and get to the point now.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2917"><span class="indent">Gazel’s personality was pretty free-spirited in reality, but he often played the role of a rigorous ruler. This was largely due to him observing the hard work of his father as he grew. While the former king still ruled the nation, Gazel was having the time of his life during the last free period of his life. Apparently, it was then that he met <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Elmesia. It was also around the time when he became an apprentice of <span data-term="Hakurou" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2918"><span class="indent">Elmesia would still bring up old tales about Gazel. She was like a close relative to him that kept on mentioning his past stories. No wonder Gazel got a headache just seeing her alone.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2919"><span class="indent">“How impatient, were you always so impetuous before?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2920"><span class="indent">Gazel hid it well enough that people couldn’t tell, but he was in fact extremely irritated. I couldn’t see it, but that was not the case for Elmesia. Picking up on people’s actual feelings was a piece of cake for the royal court. That’s why they were constantly wearing masks and deceiving each other cautiously… Looks like I needed to call Gazel my mentor in that regard, yet Elmesia was still treating him like an infant. No wonder why Gazel’s face was filled with disgust.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2921"><span class="indent">Elmesia then exclaimed, “Let me have a drink as well,” as she took a glass of fruit wine from <span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She nonchalantly sat down, seemingly in no hurry to leave.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2922"><span class="indent">Gazel and <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exchanged looks as both released a sigh. The two looked quite tacit, but they were both no different than children in Elmesia’s eyes, perhaps that’s why they were similar.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2923"><span class="indent">But of course, also myself, who’s inexperienced had no chance of winning in a negotiation with Elmesia. That’s why Gazel told me to forget about it.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2924"><span class="indent">“Ara, this tastes good as well.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2925"><span class="indent">“You are too kind.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2926"><span class="indent">The fruit wine poured by <span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have fit her appetite, filling her face with an even brighter smile.

If she were to dislike it, it would be difficult to prepare anything better. I was a little relieved as Gazel spoke up once more with emphasis.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2927"><span class="indent">“Alright, that’s enough. Time is precious, I’m afraid there’s none to waste on your little hobbies.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2928"><span class="indent">After his hurrying again, Elmesia was finally willing to talk business.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2929"><span class="indent">“Alright. If you want my help, I have something in mind for you to do as well. If you are to organize this type of celebration again, please invite me.

Gazel looked troubled as well.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2932"><span class="indent">“I am happy to do that,” I answered without hesitation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2933"><span class="indent">Elmesia smiled joyfully hearing my response. The contrast of her behavior seemed to be too drastic, perhaps I had misjudged her. But since she liked the lively time of celebration and talking about participating in said projects, it was right down my alley.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2934"><span class="indent">“Royalties are not slaves to the people. If royalties live carefreely, so will the people be joyful. I am happy too; everyone will be happy!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2935"><span class="indent">“It makes sense, and it’s my thoughts exactly. I am glad that someone is on my side, I’ll be looking forward to encountering you in the future.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2936"><span class="indent">I shook hands with Elmesia with a smile. Now Elmesia was my comrade. Aside from me and <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with the addition of Elmesia, the “Bad Idea Trio” was suddenly formed. Even though Gazel and <span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were shivering, seemingly sighting omens, we simply did not care.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2937"><span class="indent">And then Elmesia took out her magic wallet.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2938"><span class="indent">“I only have some pocket changes with me, at most one thousand gold coins. But if you want more, I can request more to be brought here.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2939"><span class="indent">“No, that should do for now. Allow me to exchange it with ten star gold coins,” I answered rather casually as well, but what on earth was this person thinking?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2940"><span class="italic indent">She’s been wandering about with a thousand gold coins. I can only say that her concept of money is a bit weird. Looks like she’s an authentic billionaire, it was the right choice to listen to Gazel’s words and not make her an enemy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2941"><span class="indent">“Alright, just remember to fulfill your promise.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2942"><span class="indent">“Of course!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2943"><span class="indent">I nodded with a smile at Elmesia’s response.

Someone tried to outsmart me, to prevent me from gaining renown, now their plan had been exposed and defeated. We didn’t need to apologize to the vendors and had saved face. It was as though I’d relieved a boulder from my heart, my mood gradually became better. At that moment, Elmesia suddenly commented something worth pondering on.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2949"><span class="indent">“But I figured, even if you didn’t have time to prepare the gold coins, someone would be willing to assist you.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2950"><span class="indent">“Hmm, what do you mean by that?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2951"><span class="indent">I didn’t understand and asked straight away.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2952"><span class="indent">“In order to make a subject obedient, rather than using sticks to coerce or intimidate, it is better to just do them a favor.

It’d be okay for them to have taken notes on paper or other items, however, since the hallways all had similar looking walls along them, they couldn’t possibly remember every single one of them.

Magic like that could generate information about locations in his brain, that is, if he could cast the magic consistently.

I heard that one swing of its giant paw can easily take someone’s life—”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3821"><span class="indent">I finally realized my mistake after hearing <span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3822"><span class="italic indent">Right, this isn’t actually a video game.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3823"><span class="indent">Basson and his men were, after all, professional adventurers. They didn’t want any of their men to be injured. Even the slightest misstep could have cost them their lives, and so they would most definitely avoid fighting <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that yielded no profit. Even though they didn’t really need to worry about dying in there, it would take some time for people to actually accept such a mindset.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3824"><span class="italic indent">With that in mind, perhaps I should re-evaluate how I’ve been trying to promote the labyrinth…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3825"><span class="indent">And soon, the battle began.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3826"><span class="indent">Basson lunged forward to take on the great-bear’s attack. A look of desperation was etched on his face. The only thing between him and the <span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a worn-out piece of leather armor. A piece that didn’t cover up his entire body and left his hands and lower sides completely exposed. He found himself in quite the precarious situation despite confronting an opponent weaker than himself. His great axe could land heavy chopping blows, yet it was not suitable to defend against a bear’s claws. That’s why Basson had been using his round shield to deflect the great-bear’s paw.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3827"><span class="indent">His companions, on the other hand, were covering for Basson. To keep themselves safe, they were targeting the eyes and feet of the great-bear when launching attacks. The magician named Gomez, meanwhile, launched the great-magic spell Wind Slash to take its life.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3828"><span class="indent">“And it’s at this moment that their battle to the death with the great-bear concludes! An excellent fight!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3829"><span class="indent">“Indeed. Their actions were very logical and devoid of unnecessary complications. That was the style of experienced fighters.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3830"><span class="indent">As I listened to <span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s broadcast, I mulled over the fight just now. Indeed, their teamwork was flawless. In the end, there were no casualties in Basson’s team, and they took around five minutes to take down the great-bear.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3831"><span class="indent">But I couldn’t shake off the troubles as new problems started to emerge.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3832"><span class="indent">“Oi oi oi, I didn’t expect them to fight so cautiously against an enemy far weaker than themselves…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3833"><span class="indent">“Um—I was surprised too. But shouldn’t that normally be the case?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3834"><span class="indent">“I suppose. Although not having drawn a map is indicative of poor performance, we seem to have underestimated their abilities.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3835"><span class="indent">“That’s true, maybe it will take three days just to break through the first floor alone…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3836"><span class="indent">“Um—if that’s the case, we should really think about quantifying the rations…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3837"><span class="indent">I didn’t expect our project to be disrupted by something like this.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3838"><span class="indent">Basson’s team had teammates of varying ranks, but their overall strength was the equivalent of Rank B. As for Basson and Gomez, with their good equipment, they may have been around Rank B in terms of skill. Yet we couldn’t have anticipated that such a six-man team had to struggle in a fight on the second floor already.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3839"><span class="indent">In terms of results alone, it was their complete victory, though taking five minutes was perhaps way too long. However, as professional adventurers, they might also value safety more…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3840"><span class="indent">Maybe they should be taught to adapt different fighting strategies, perhaps they could adhere to the strategy of “Use healing potions even if it’s only a scratch” to improve their combat efficiency.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3841"><span class="indent">Not sure why I was worried, but right now Basson’s party was approaching the treasure chest.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3842"><span class="indent">“It looks like the room contained a treasure chest, it looks silver as well, what could possibly be inside…?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3843"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words had tensed up the audience. While the other teams had opened treasure chests several times by now, people were still highly interested in the instant that they were opened.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3844"><span class="indent">One of Basson’s teammates went up and immediately threw the lid open.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3845"><span class="italic indent">Oi oi oi, shouldn’t you at least check for traps?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3846"><span class="indent">Silver chests weren’t set with traps, but Basson’s team had no clue of that. Just before this, they had gotten poisoned with paralysis and enveloped with sleeping gas. They also seemed to be taking turns when opening chests, but this wasn’t a punishment game… Their crude way of opening the chest even put me, as a spectator, on edge.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3847"><span class="indent">In this regard, in the eyes of me, an epic gamer, I could only call them amateurs.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3848"><span class="indent">Having treasure chests inside labyrinths was a foreign concept to people here… is that why they were so quick to do something so reckless? From this point of view, <span data-term="Elen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party was at least somewhat better. Their team had Gido, who, so far, had ensured that they wouldn’t trigger any traps while extracting items from treasure chests.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3849"><span class="indent">Basson’s team’s issue probably came down to them not having a thief. Professional adventurers that exterminated <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were probably the buff type who weren’t suited for situations like this. They should have hired teammates specializing in exploration.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3850"><span class="italic indent">Hold up?</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3851"><span class="indent">It may be that the difficulty of the labyrinth was higher than we expected. I thought that the issue was Basson’s party not being professional enough, but it would seem that a lot of people were simply not good at exploring a labyrinth. Their walkthrough couldn’t be made faster.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3852"><span class="indent">I needed to reflect on the issue.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3853"><span class="indent">“OH, WOWOWO! Basson-aniki, it’s a sword!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3854"><span class="italic indent">NICU!</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3855"><span class="indent">They seemed to have hit the jackpot. Moreover, the rare-grade jackpot deluxe. There were many different types of rewards, such as high-grade healing potions, ancient gold coins, or fine quality gear etc. We also designed it so that, starting from level two, there would be a very low chance of the reward being a rare-grade item.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3856"><span class="indent">What Basson got was a rare-grade sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3857"><span class="indent">“By the way, Mentor said that all of the treasure chests were designed to have higher reward drop rates!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3858"><span class="indent">“I-is that so? But so far they have been getting shit rewards all around…”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3859"><span class="indent">It was rare for Veldora to be so generous, yet it was ruined by Basson’s bad luck. No, had Veldora not raised the probability, they could have been getting shit gear even now.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3860"><span class="indent">With that being said, obtaining this rare-grade sword was a game-changer for them. This would be great for publicity. Basson’s team would probably also want to test their luck even more. Upon thinking so, I had to compliment Veldora with a “Good job”.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3861"><span class="indent">“For Veldora, this decision has been amazing. If you failed to leave these folks with some good memories, it would affect the future of the labyrinth exploration.”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3862"><span class="italic indent">I’ll thank Veldora later.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3863"><span class="indent">Basson’s men whistled upon laying eyes on the sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3864"><span class="indent">They seemed to be very fond of the treasure.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3865"><span class="indent">“You guys, let’s keep on going at this pace!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3866"><span class="indent">Basson sheathed his great axe and changed his weapon to the sword.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3867"><span class="indent">In the next room, three Rank D bats appeared, all cut down by him in one smooth slash. The quality of the sword had perhaps added a bonus to their overall effectiveness, they seemed to have become faster in dealing with enemies.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3868"><span class="indent">This was a sword crafted by <span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciple. It barely made it to the level of rare-grade, however, to Basson’s party, it was a mighty sword, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3869"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Kai" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was no exception in this regard. I heard that even the elite of Rank A had difficulty in gathering a full set of rare-grade gear. No wonder why Basson and his boys were so happy.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3870"><span class="indent">As if they were making up for their previous losses, the party pushed forward confidently. In addition, they also seemed to have obtained many “Magic Crystals” from the <span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3871"><span class="indent">“This sword is really nice, now we’re making some profit.

These folks were operating cautiously with safety in mind. One could say that they were overly cautious.

Yet to their surprise, there was a turn of events.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3878"><span class="indent">“Have we farmed enough?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3879"><span class="indent">“Are we really going there now?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3880"><span class="indent">“Uh… Aren’t you going to ask me about it…?”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3881"><span class="indent">“Of course we are going!

Next time before you go public, could you at least give me a heads up and discuss it with me a bit,” Gazel, looking worn out, gave me this rather straight-forward bit of advice.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4428"><span class="indent">To us, the projector’s value was that it was a convenient and irreplaceable invention for entertainment. But to the eyes of the kings and nobles of the Western Nations, it was an entirely different case.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4429"><span class="indent">“This thing has way too many applications, to the point that they’re uncountable. At least to the crowd at the scene, everyone could tell its value,” Gazel said unpleasantly.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4430"><span class="italic indent">I just thought that it would be great to have a large screen to watch the expanded footage of the martial tournament and the labyrinth interior. And the people loved it too…</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4431"><span class="indent">But the device had given the officials of different nations quite a cultural shock, it seemed.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4432"><span class="indent">“With something like that, it would change the whole concept of war,” Gazel’s friend <span data-term="Pann" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, <span data-term="Dorf" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san also nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4433"><span class="indent">They said that an immediate application would be in the military. One huge advantage was that they could now command the army from a safe distance. The officials of the army no longer had to risk themselves in any dangerous situation. Instead they could send out scout troops to check on the enemy status and quickly gain feedback to apply to their own army.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4434"><span class="indent">As opposed to the one-to-one “Magic Communication”, this method would enable many times more volume of intelligence transfer. Everyone could share the same batch of information, and the accuracy of command would be greatly improved.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4435"><span class="indent">We published the technology at random, and it could already be called ultra-futuristic. It seemed to be a revolutionary technology.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4436"><span class="indent">I was only thinking “It’ll be good to have something like this” and ordered people to construct the device. Yet it turned out that we made something incredible.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4437"><span class="indent">I muttered unconsciously that “You should have told me this earlier,” but I was met with Gazel’s stare and scolding “That was my line!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4438"><span class="italic indent">I am reflecting now, but that’s not the point of this meeting. Not everything in this world will go according to our heart’s content.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4439"><span class="indent">“B-but, you must require a high level of magicule to operate the machine. If the mana of the user isn’t high enough, it won’t work. The distance and quantity of the intelligence transfer also depends on the user’s ability. It’s not that simple to apply it universally!”</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4440"><span class="indent">I managed to cover my tail with this explanation. I had actually made improvements regarding these drawbacks by developing a system to store magicule. But it would be wise to save these words for later discussions with Gazel in private.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4441"><span class="indent">“Anyhow, just don’t publish something that can be suspected to be of military usage so casually. You’re the only one who wants to use it for entertainment…” Gazel told me, baffled.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4442"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4443"><span class="indent">And when I thought it was over, it was Elmesia’s turn to cut in.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4444"><span class="indent">“I can actually purchase similar inventions in the future.

Elmesia also agreed happily. The two were sitting together like close siblings.

You can’t fake a friendship like that, they were really close to each other, going so far as to give high-fives. I couldn’t feel their difference in status at all.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4454"><span class="indent">Even the aristocrats of the Western Nations couldn’t approach her—to most, Emperor Elmesia <span data-term="Elaure" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Sarion was indeed such an elusive top figure.

For instance, the plumbing required for facilities relying on water, such as a kitchen, bathroom, or toilet, were all the product of dwarven technology contributed by Kaijin and the other dwarves. I wasn’t sure whether technicians from <span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could recreate them or not, but it would also take too much time for them to learn the technology from scratch.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4463"><span class="indent">With that being the case, it would be faster for us to export the domestically produced machine parts directly to <span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4464"><span class="indent">“Since you are sending the parts, I hope you will be using that thing called a train.

King Dolam also predicted that our nation will become an important hub for the flow of goods. I’ve also had my theory before finally understanding after hearing your speech. In other words, your Majesty wishes to make our country a gathering point of all exports, is that right? Your Majesty mentioned that once this ‘Magic Train’ appears, the concept of logistics would change forever. If you are making our nation into a hub of sorts, surely goods from all over the continent would come through. In that case, we will need people managing these goods.
